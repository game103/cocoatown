<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">At last the people in a body<br></span>
<span class="i2">To the Town Hall came flocking:<br></span>
<span class="i0">"Tis clear," cried they, "our Mayor's a noddy;<br></span>
<span class="i2">And as for our Corporationâ€”shocking<br></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
<span class="i0">To think we buy gowns lined with ermine<br></span>
<span class="i0">For dolts that can't or won't determine<br></span>
<span class="i0">What's best to rid us of our vermin!<br></span>
<span class="i0">You hope, because you're old and obese,<br></span>
<span class="i0">To find in the furry civic robe ease?<br></span>
<span class="i0">Rouse up, sirs! Give your brains a racking<br></span>
<span class="i0">To find the remedy we're lacking,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Or, sure as fate, we'll send you packing!"<br></span>
<span class="i0">At this the Mayor and Corporation<br></span>
<span class="i0">Quaked with a mighty consternation.<br></span>
</div></div>



<h3>IV.</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">An hour they sate in council,<br></span>
<span class="i2">At length the Mayor broke silence:<br></span>
<span class="i0">"For a guilder I'd my ermine gown sell;<br></span>
<span class="i2">I wish I were a mile hence!<br></span>
<span class="i0">It's easy to bid one rack one's brainâ€”<br></span>
<span class="i0">I'm sure my poor head aches again,<br></span>
<span class="i0">I've scratched it so, and all in vain<br></span>
<span class="i0">Oh for a trap, a trap, a trap!"<br></span>
<span class="i0">Just as he said this, what should hap<br></span>
<span class="i0">At the chamber door but a gentle tap?<br></span>
<span class="i0">"Bless us," cried the Mayor, "what's that?"<br></span>
<span class="i0">(With the Corporation as he sat,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Looking little though wondrous fat;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Nor brighter was his eye, nor moister<br></span>
<span class="i0">Than a too-long-opened oyster,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Save when at noon his paunch grew mutinous<br></span>
<span class="i0">For a plate of turtle green and glutinous)<br></span>
<span class="i2">"Only a scraping of shoes on the mat?<br></span>
<span class="i2">Anything like the sound of a rat<br></span>
<span class="i2">Makes my heart go pit-a-pat!"<br></span>
</div></div>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>



<h3>V.</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Come in!"â€”the Mayor cried, looking bigger:<br></span>
<span class="i0">And in did come the strangest figure!<br></span>
<span class="i0">His queer long coat from heel to head<br></span>
<span class="i0">Was half of yellow and half of red,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And he himself was tall and thin,<br></span>
<span class="i0">With sharp blue eyes, each like a pin,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And light loose hair, yet swarthy skin<br></span>
<span class="i0">No tuft on cheek nor beard on chin,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But lips where smile went out and in;<br></span>
<span class="i0">There was no guessing his kith and kin:<br></span>
<span class="i0">And nobody could enough admire<br></span>
<span class="i0">The tall man and his quaint attire.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Quoth one: "It's as my great-grandsire,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Starting up at the Trump of Doom's tone,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Had walked this way from his painted tombstone!"<br></span>
</div></div>



<h3>VI.</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He advanced to the council-table:<br></span>
<span class="i0">And, "Please your honours," said he, "I'm able,<br></span>
<span class="i0">By means of a secret charm, to draw<br></span>
<span class="i0">All creatures living beneath the sun,<br></span>
<span class="i0">That creep or swim or fly or run,<br></span>
<span class="i0">After me so as you never saw!<br></span>
<span class="i0">And I chiefly use my charm<br></span>
<span class="i0">On creatures that do people harm,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The mole and toad and newt and viper;<br></span>
<span class="i0">And people call me the Pied Piper."<br></span>
<span class="i0">(And here they noticed round his neck<br></span>
<span class="i0">A scarf of red and yellow stripe,<br></span>
<span class="i0">To match with his coat of the self-same cheque;<br></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And at the scarf's end hung a pipe;<br></span>
<span class="i0">And his fingers they noticed were ever straying<br></span>
<span class="i0">As if impatient to be playing<br></span>
<span class="i0">Upon his pipe, as low it dangled<br></span>
<span class="i0">Over his vesture so old-fangled.)<br></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Yet," said he, "poor Piper as I am,<br></span>
<span class="i0">In Tartary I freed the Cham,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Last June, from his huge swarms of gnats,<br></span>
<span class="i0">I eased in Asia the Nizam<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of a monstrous brood of vampyre-bats:<br></span>
<span class="i0">And as for what your brain bewilders,<br></span>
<span class="i0">If I can rid your town of rats<br></span>
<span class="i0">Will you give me a thousand guilders?"<br></span>
<span class="i0">"One? fifty thousand!"â€”was the exclamation<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of the astonished Mayor and Corporation.<br></span>

<h3>VII.</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Into the street the Piper stept,<br></span>
<span class="i2">Smiling first a little smile,<br></span>
<span class="i0">As if he knew what magic slept<br></span>
<span class="i2">In his quiet pipe the while;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then, like a musical adept,<br></span>
<span class="i0">To blow the pipe his lips he wrinkled,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And green and blue his sharp eyes twinkled,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Like a candle-flame where salt is sprinkled;<br></span>
<span class="i0">And ere three shrill notes the pipe uttered,<br></span>
<span class="i0">You heard as if an army muttered;<br></span>

<span class="i0">And the muttering grew to a grumbling;<br></span>
<span class="i0">And the grumbling grew to a mighty rumbling;<br></span>
<span class="i0">And out of the houses the rats came tumbling.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Great rats, small rats, lean rats, brawny rats,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Brown rats, black rats, grey rats, tawny rats,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Grave old plodders, gay young friskers,<br></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
<span class="i2">Fathers, mothers, uncles, cousins,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Cocking tails and pricking whiskers,<br></span>
<span class="i2">Families by tens and dozens,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Brothers, sisters, husbands, wivesâ€”<br></span>
<span class="i0">Followed the Piper for their lives.<br></span>
<span class="i0">From street to street he piped advancing,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And step for step they followed dancing,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Until they came to the river Weser<br></span>
<span class="i0">Wherein all plunged and perished!<br></span>
<span class="i0">â€”Save one who, stout as Julius CÄ‡sar,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Swam across and lived to carry<br></span>
<span class="i0">(As he, the manuscript he cherished)<br></span>
<span class="i0">To Rat-land home his commentary:<br></span>
<span class="i0">Which was, "At the first shrill notes of the pipe,<br></span>
<span class="i0">I heard a sound as of scraping tripe,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And putting apples, wondrous ripe,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Into a cider-press's gripe:<br></span>
<span class="i0">And a moving away of pickle-tub-boards,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And a leaving ajar of conserve-cupboards,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And a drawing the corks of train-oil-flasks,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And a breaking the hoops of butter-casks:<br></span>
<span class="i0">And it seemed as if a voice<br></span>
<span class="i0">(Sweeter far than by harp or by psaltery<br></span>
<span class="i0">Is breathed) called out, 'Oh rats, rejoice!<br></span>
<span class="i0">The world is grown to one vast drysaltery!<br></span>
<span class="i0">So munch on, crunch on, take your nuncheon,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Breakfast, supper, dinner, luncheon!'<br></span>
<span class="i0">And just as a bulky sugar-puncheon,<br></span>
<span class="i0">All ready staved, like a great sun shone<br></span>
<span class="i0">Glorious scarce an inch before me,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Just as methought it said, 'Come, bore me!'<br></span>
<span class="i0">â€”I found the Weser rolling o'er me."<br></span>

<span class="i0">A thousand guilders! The Mayor looked blue;<br></span>
<span class="i0">So did the Corporation too.<br></span>
<span class="i0">For council dinners made rare havoc<br></span>
<span class="i0">With Claret, Moselle, Vin-de-Grave, Hock;<br></span>
<span class="i0">And half the money would replenish<br></span>
<span class="i0">Their cellar's biggest butt with Rhenish.<br></span>
<span class="i0">To pay this sum to a wandering fellow<br></span>
<span class="i0">With a gipsy coat of red and yellow!<br></span>
<span class="i0">"Beside," quoth the Mayor with a knowing wink,<br></span>
<span class="i0">"Our business was done at the river's brink;<br></span>
<span class="i0">We saw with our eyes the vermin sink,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And what's dead can't come to life, I think.<br></span>
<span class="i0">So, friend, we're not the folks to shrink<br></span>
<span class="i0">From the duty of giving you something to drink,<br></span>

<span class="i0">The Mayor was dumb, and the Council stood<br></span>
<span class="i0">As if they were changed into blocks of wood,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Unable to move a step, or cry<br></span>
<span class="i0">To the children merrily skipping by.<br></span>

<span class="i0">â€”Could only follow with the eye<br></span>
<span class="i0">That joyous crowd at the Piper's back.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But how the Mayor was on the rack,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And the wretched Council's bosoms beat,<br></span>
<span class="i0">As the Piper turned from the High Street<br></span>
<span class="i0">To where the Weser rolled its waters<br></span>
<span class="i0">Right in the way of their sons and daughters!<br></span>
<span class="i0">However he turned from South to West,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And to Koppelberg Hill his steps addressed,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And after him the children pressed;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Great was the joy in every breast.<br></span>
<span class="i0">"He never can cross that mighty top!<br></span>
<span class="i0">He's forced to let the piping drop,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And we shall see our children stop!"<br></span>
<span class="i0">When, lo, as they reached the mountain-side,<br></span>
<span class="i0">A wondrous portal opened wide,<br></span>
<span class="i0">As if a cavern was suddenly hollowed;<br></span>
<span class="i0">And the Piper advanced and the children followed,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And when all were in to the very last,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The door in the mountain side shut fast.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Did I say, all? No; One was lame,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And could not dance the whole of the way;<br></span>
<span class="i0">And in after years, if you would blame<br></span>
<span class="i0">His sadness, he was used to say,â€”<br></span>
<span class="i0">"It's dull in our town since my playmates left!<br></span>
<span class="i0">I can't forget that I'm bereft<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of all the pleasant sights they see,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Which the Piper also promised me.<br></span>
<span class="i0">For he led us, he said, to a joyous land,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Joining the town and just at hand,<br></span>

<span class="i0">The sparrows were brighter than peacocks here,<br></span>

     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
