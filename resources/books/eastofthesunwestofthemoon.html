<h2>PREFACE</h2>
</div>
<p>A folk-tale, in its primitive plainness of word
and entire absence of complexity in thought,
is peculiarly sensitive and susceptible to the
touch of stranger hands; and he who has been able to
acquaint himself with the <i>Norske Folkeeventyr</i> of Asbjörnsen
and Moe (from which these stories are selected),
has an advantage over the reader of an English rendering.
Of this advantage Mr. Kay Nielsen has fully availed
himself: and the exquisite <i>bizarrerie</i> of his drawings
aptly expresses the innermost significance of the old-world,
old-wives’ fables. For to term these legends,
Nursery Tales, would be to curtail them, by nine-tenths,
of their interest. They are the romances of the childhood
of Nations: they are the never-failing springs of sentiment,
of sensation, of heroic example, from which primeval
peoples drank their fill at will.</p>
<p>The quaintness, the tenderness, the grotesque yet
realistic intermingling of actuality with supernaturalism,
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_3" name="page_3"></a>3</span>
by which the original <i>Norske Folkeeventyr</i> are characterised,
will make an appeal to all, as represented in the pictures
of Kay Nielsen. And these imperishable traditions, whose
bases are among the very roots of all antiquity, are here
reincarnated in line and colour, to the delight of all who
ever knew or now shall know them.</p>
<p>Permission to reprint the Stories in this book, which
originally appeared in Sir G. W. Dasent’s “Popular Tales
from the Norse,” has been obtained from Messrs. George
Routledge &amp; Sons, Ltd. <span class="smcap">The Three Princesses in the
Blue Mountain</span> is printed by arrangement with Messrs.
David Nutt; and <span class="smcap">Prince Lindworm</span> is newly translated for

<p><img class="dcap" src="./eastofthesunwestofthemoon_files/drop_o.png" alt="O" title="" width="75" height="73"><span class="smcap"><span class="dcap">O</span>nce</span> on a time there was a poor husbandman
who had so many children that he hadn’t much
of either food or clothing to give them. Pretty
children they all were, but the prettiest was the youngest
daughter, who was so lovely there was no end to her
loveliness.</p>
<p>So one day, ’twas on a Thursday evening late at the
fall of the year, the weather was so wild and rough outside,
and it was so cruelly dark, and rain fell and wind blew,
till the walls of the cottage shook again. There they all
sat round the fire, busy with this thing and that. But
just then, all at once something gave three taps on the
window-pane. Then the father went out to see what
was the matter; and, when he got out of doors, what
should he see but a great big <i>White Bear</i>.</p>
<p>“Good-evening to you!” said the <i>White Bear</i>.</p>
<p>“The same to you!” said the man.</p>
<p>“Will you give me your youngest daughter? If you
will, I’ll make you as rich as you are now poor,” said
the <i>Bear</i>.</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_10" name="page_10"></a>10</span></div>
<p>Well, the man would not be at all sorry to be so rich;
but still he thought he must have a bit of a talk with his
daughter first; so he went in and told them how there
was a great <i>White Bear</i> waiting outside, who had given
his word to make them so rich if he could only have the
youngest daughter.</p>
<p>The lassie said “No!” outright. Nothing could get
her to say anything else; so the man went out and settled
it with the <i>White Bear</i> that he should come again the
next Thursday evening and get an answer. Meantime he
talked his daughter over, and kept on telling her of all
the riches they would get, and how well off she would be
herself; and so at last she thought better of it, and washed
and mended her rags, made herself as smart as she could,
and was ready to start. I can’t say her packing gave her
much trouble.</p>

</div>
<p>Next Thursday evening came the <i>White Bear</i> to fetch
her, and she got upon his back with her bundle, and off
they went. So, when they had gone a bit of the way,
the <i>White Bear</i> said:</p>
<p>“Are you afraid?”</p>
<p>“No,” she wasn’t.</p>
<p>“Well! mind and hold tight by my shaggy coat, and
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_11" name="page_11"></a>11</span>
then there’s nothing
to fear,” said
the <i>Bear</i>.</p>
<p>So she rode a
long, long way,
till they came to a
great steep hill.
There, on the face
of it, the <i>White
Bear</i> gave a knock,
and a door opened,
and they came into
a castle where
there were many
rooms all lit up; rooms gleaming with silver and gold;
and there, too, was a table ready laid, and it was all as
grand as grand could be. Then the <i>White Bear</i> gave her
a silver bell; and when she wanted anything, she was only
to ring it, and she would get it at once.</p>
<p>Well, after she had eaten and drunk, and evening wore
on, she got sleepy after her journey, and thought she would
like to go to bed, so she rang the bell; and she had scarce
taken hold of it before she came into a chamber where there
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_12" name="page_12"></a>12</span>
was a bed made, as fair and white as any one would wish
to sleep in, with silken pillows and curtains and gold fringe.
All that was in the room was gold or silver; but when she
had gone to bed and put out the light, a man came and
laid himself alongside her. That was the <i>White Bear</i>, who
threw off his beast shape at night; but she never saw him,
for he always came after she had put out the light, and
before the day dawned he was up and off again. So things
went on happily for a while, but at last she began to get
silent and sorrowful; for there she went about all day
alone, and she longed to go home to see her father and
mother and brothers and sisters. So one day, when the
<i>White Bear</i> asked what it was that she lacked, she said it
was so dull and lonely there, and how she longed to go
home to see her father and mother and brothers and
sisters, and that was why she was so sad and sorrowful,
because she couldn’t get to them.</p>
<p>“Well, well!” said the <i>Bear</i>, “perhaps there’s a cure
for all this; but you must promise me one thing, not to
talk alone with your mother, but only when the rest are
by to hear; for she’ll take you by the hand and try to
lead you into a room alone to talk; but you must mind
and not do that, else you’ll bring bad luck on both of us.”</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_13" name="page_13"></a>13</span></div>
<p>So one Sunday the <i>White Bear</i> came and said, now
they could set off to see her father and mother. Well,
off they started, she sitting on his back; and they went
far and long. At last they came to a grand house, and
there her brothers and sisters were running about out of
doors at play, and everything was so pretty, ’twas a joy
to see.</p>
<p>“This is where your father and mother live now,” said
the <i>White Bear</i>; “but don’t forget what I told you, else
you’ll make us both unlucky.”</p>
<p>“No! bless her, she’d not forget;”—and when she had
reached the house, the <i>White Bear</i> turned right about
and left her.</p>
<p>Then, when she went in to see her father and mother,
there was such joy, there was no end to it. None of
them thought they could thank her enough for all she
had done for them. Now, they had everything they
wished, as good as good could be, and they all wanted
to know how she got on where she lived.</p>
<p>Well, she said, it was very good to live where she did;
she had all she wished. What she said beside I don’t
know, but I don’t think any of them had the right end of
the stick, or that they got much out of her. But so, in
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_14" name="page_14"></a>14</span>
the afternoon, after they had done dinner, all happened
as the <i>White Bear</i> had said. Her mother wanted to talk
with her alone in her bedroom; but she minded what
the <i>White Bear</i> had said, and wouldn’t go upstairs.</p>
<p>“Oh! what we have to talk about will keep!” she said,
and put her mother off. But, somehow or other, her
mother got round her at last, and she had to tell her the
whole story. So she said, how every night when she had
gone to bed a man came and lay down beside her as soon
as she had put out the light; and how she never saw him,
because he was always up and away before the morning
dawned; and how she went about woeful and sorrowing,
for she thought she should so like to see him; and how
all day long she walked about there alone; and how dull
and dreary and lonesome it was.</p>
<p>“My!” said her mother; “it may well be a Troll you
slept with! But now I’ll teach you a lesson how to set
eyes on him. I’ll give you a bit of candle, which you
can carry home in your bosom; just light that while he
is asleep, but take care not to drop the tallow on him.”</p>
<p>Yes! she took the candle and hid it in her bosom,
and as night drew on, the <i>White Bear</i> came and fetched
her away.</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_15" name="page_15"></a>15</span></div>
<p>But when they had gone a bit of the way, the <i>White
Bear</i> asked if all hadn’t happened as he had said.</p>
<p>“Well, she couldn’t say it hadn’t.”</p>
<p>“Now, mind,” said he, “if you have listened to your
mother’s advice, you have brought bad luck on us both, and
then, all that has passed between us will be as nothing.”</p>
<p>“No,” she said, “she hadn’t listened to her mother’s
advice.”</p>
<p>So when she reached home, and had gone to bed, it
was the old story over again. There came a man and lay
down beside her; but at dead of night, when she heard
he slept, she got up and struck a light, lit the candle, and
let the light shine on him, and so she saw that he was the
loveliest <i>Prince</i> one ever set eyes on, and she fell so deep
in love with him on the spot, that she thought she couldn’t
live if she didn’t give him a kiss there and then. And so
she did; but as she kissed him, she dropped three hot
drops of tallow on his shirt, and he woke up.</p>
<p>“What have you done?” he cried; “now you have
made us both unlucky, for had you held out only this
one year, I had been freed. For I have a step-mother
who has bewitched me, so that I am a <i>White Bear</i> by
day, and a <i>Man</i> by night. But now all ties are snapt
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_16" name="page_16"></a>16</span>
between us; now I must set off from you to her. She
lives in a Castle which stands <i>East of the Sun and West
of the Moon</i>, and there, too, is a <i>Princess</i>, with a nose
three ells long, and she’s the wife I must have now.”</p>
<p>She wept and took it ill, but there was no help for it;
go he must.</p>
<p>Then she asked if she mightn’t go with him.</p>
<p>No, she mightn’t.</p>
<p>“Tell me the way, then,” she said, “and I’ll search
you out; <i>that</i> surely I may get leave to do.”</p>

<i>“Tell me the way, then,” she said, “and I’ll search you out.”</i><br>
</p>
</div>
<p>“Yes,” she might do that, he said; “but there was
no way to that place. It lay <i>East of the Sun and West
of the Moon</i>, and thither she’d never find her way.”</p>
<p>So next morning, when she woke up, both <i>Prince</i> and
castle were gone, and then she lay on a little green patch,
in the midst of the gloomy thick wood, and by her side
lay the same bundle of rags she had brought with her from
her old home.</p>

</div>
<p>So when she had rubbed the sleep out of her eyes, and
wept till she was tired, she set out on her way, and walked
many, many days, till she came to a lofty crag. Under it
sat an old hag, and played with a gold apple which she
tossed about. Here the lassie asked if she knew the way
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_17" name="page_17"></a>17</span>
to the Prince, who
lived with his
step-mother in the
Castle, that lay
<i>East of the Sun
and West of the
Moon</i>, and who
was to marry the
<i>Princess</i> with a
nose three ells
long.</p>
<p>“How did
you come to know
about him?” asked
the old hag; “but maybe you are the lassie who ought to
have had him?”</p>
<p>Yes, she was.</p>
<p>“So, so; it’s you, is it?” said the old hag. “Well,
all I know about him is, that he lives in the castle that
lies <i>East of the Sun and West of the Moon</i>, and thither
you’ll come, late or never; but still you may have the loan
of my horse, and on him you can ride to my next neighbour.
Maybe she’ll be able to tell you; and when you
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_18" name="page_18"></a>18</span>
get there, just give the horse a switch under the left ear,
and beg him to be off home; and, stay, this gold apple
you may take with you.”</p>
<p>So she got upon the horse, and rode a long, long time,
till she came to another crag, under which sat another old
hag, with a gold carding-comb. Here the lassie asked if
she knew the way to the castle that lay <i>East of the Sun
and West of the Moon</i>, and she answered, like the first
old hag, that she knew nothing about it, except it was east
of the sun and west of the moon.</p>
<p>“And thither you’ll come, late or never, but you shall
have the loan of my horse to my next neighbour; maybe
she’ll tell you all about it; and when you get there, just switch
the horse under the left ear, and beg him to be off home.”</p>
<p>And this old hag gave her the golden carding-comb;
it might be she’d find some use for it, she said. So the
lassie got up on the horse, and rode a far, far way, and a
weary time; and so at last she came to another great crag,
under which sat another old hag, spinning with a golden
spinning-wheel. Her, too, she asked if she knew the way
to the <i>Prince</i>, and where the castle was that lay <i>East of
the Sun and West of the Moon</i>. So it was the same thing
over again.</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_19" name="page_19"></a>19</span></div>
<p>“Maybe it’s you who ought to have had the <i>Prince</i>?”
said the old hag.</p>
<p>Yes, it was.</p>
<p>But she, too, didn’t know the way a bit better than the
other two. “East of the sun and west of the moon it
was,” she knew—that was all.</p>
<p>“And thither you’ll come, late or never; but I’ll lend
you my horse, and then I think you’d best ride to the
East Wind and ask him; maybe he knows those parts, and
can blow you thither. But when you get to him, you
need only give the horse a switch under the left ear, and
he’ll trot home of himself.”</p>
<p>And so, too, she gave her the gold spinning-wheel.
“Maybe you’ll find a use for it,” said the old hag.</p>
<p>Then on she rode many many days, a weary time,
before she got to the East Wind’s house, but at last she
did reach it, and then she asked the East Wind if he could
tell her the way to the <i>Prince</i> who dwelt east of the sun
and west of the moon. Yes, the East Wind had often
heard tell of it, the <i>Prince</i> and the castle, but he couldn’t
tell the way, for he had never blown so far.</p>
<p>“But, if you will, I’ll go with you to my brother the
West Wind, maybe he knows, for he’s much stronger.
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_20" name="page_20"></a>20</span>
So, if you will just get on my back, I’ll carry you thither.”</p>
<p>Yes, she got on his back, and I should just think they
went briskly along.</p>
<p>So when they got there, they went into the West
Wind’s house, and the East Wind said the lassie he had
brought was the one who ought to have had the <i>Prince</i>
who lived in the castle <i>East of the Sun and West of the
Moon</i>; and so she had set out to seek him, and how he
had come with her, and would be glad to know if the
West Wind knew how to get to the castle.</p>
<p>“Nay,” said the West Wind, “so far I’ve never blown;
but if you will, I’ll go with you to our brother the South
Wind, for he’s much stronger than either of us, and he
has flapped his wings far and wide. Maybe he’ll tell you.
You can get on my back, and I’ll carry you to him.”</p>
<p>Yes! she got on his back, and so they travelled to the South
Wind, and weren’t so very long on the way, I should think.</p>
<p>When they got there, the West Wind asked him if he
could tell her the way to the castle that lay <i>East of the
Sun and West of the Moon</i>, for it was she who ought to
have had the <i>Prince</i> who lived there.</p>
<p>“You don’t say so! That’s she, is it?” said the South
Wind.</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_21" name="page_21"></a>21</span></div>
<p>“Well, I have blustered about in most places in my time,
but so far have I never blown; but if you will, I’ll take
you to my brother the North Wind; he is the oldest and
strongest of the whole lot of us, and if he don’t know
where it is, you’ll never find any one in the world to tell
you. You can get on my back, and I’ll carry you thither.”</p>
<p>Yes! she got on his back, and away he went from his
house at a fine rate. And this time, too, she wasn’t long
on her way.</p>
<p>So when they got to the North Wind’s house, he was
so wild and cross, cold puffs came from him a long way
off.</p>
<p>“<span class="smcap">Blast you both, what do you want?</span>” he roared out
to them ever so far off, so that it struck them with an icy
shiver.</p>
<p>“Well,” said the South Wind, “you needn’t be so foul-mouthed,
for here I am, your brother, the South Wind,
and here is the lassie who ought to have had the <i>Prince</i>
who dwells in the castle that lies <i>East of the Sun and
West of the Moon</i>, and now she wants to ask you if you
ever were there, and can tell her the way, for she would
be so glad to find him again.”</p>
<p>“<span class="smcap">Yes, I know well enough where it is</span>,” said the North
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_22" name="page_22"></a>22</span>
Wind; “once in my life I blew an aspen-leaf thither, but,
I was so tired I couldn’t blow a puff for ever so many days,
after. But if you really wish to go thither, and aren’t
afraid to come along with me, I’ll take you on my back
and see if I can blow you thither.”</p>
<p>Yes! with all her heart; she must and would get
thither if it were possible in any way; and as for fear,
however madly he went, she wouldn’t be at all afraid.</p>
<p>“Very well, then,” said the North Wind, “but you
must sleep here to-night, for we must have the whole day
before us, if we’re to get thither at all.”</p>
<p>Early next morning the North Wind woke her, and
puffed himself up, and blew himself out, and made himself
so stout and big, ’twas gruesome to look at him; and so
off they went high up through the air, as if they would
never stop till they got to the world’s end.</p>
<p>Down here below there was such a storm; it threw
down long tracts of wood and many houses, and when it
swept over the great sea, ships foundered by hundreds.</p>
<div class="figtag">
<a name="linki_10" id="linki_10"></a>

<p class="caption">
<i>The North Wind goes over the sea.</i><br>
</p>
</div>
<p>So they tore on and on—no one can believe how far
they went—and all the while they still went over the sea,
and the North Wind got more and more weary, and so
out of breath he could scarce bring out a puff, and his
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_23" name="page_23"></a>23</span>
wings drooped and drooped, till at last he sunk so low
that the crests of the waves dashed over his heels.</p>
<p>“Are you afraid?” said the North Wind.</p>
<p>“No!” she wasn’t.</p>
<p>But they weren’t very far from land; and the North
Wind had still so much strength left in him that he
managed to throw her up on the shore under the windows
of the castle which lay <i>East of the Sun and West of the Moon</i>;
but then he was so weak and worn out, he had to stay
there and rest many days before he could get home again.</p>
<p>Next morning the lassie sat down under the castle
window, and began to play with the gold apple; and the
first person she saw was the <i>Long-nose</i> who was to have
the <i>Prince</i>.</p>
<p>“What do you want for your gold apple, you lassie?”
said the <i>Long-nose</i>, and threw up the window.</p>
<p>“It’s not for sale, for gold or money,” said the lassie.</p>
<p>“If it’s not for sale for gold or money, what is it that
you will sell it for? You may name your own price,”
said the <i>Princess</i>.</p>
<p>“Well! if I may get to the <i>Prince</i>, who lives here,
and be with him to-night, you shall have it,” said the lassie
whom the North Wind had brought.</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_24" name="page_24"></a>24</span></div>
<p>Yes! she might; that could be done. So the <i>Princess</i>
got the gold apple; but when the lassie came up to the
<i>Prince’s</i> bed-room at night he was fast asleep; she called
him and shook him, and between whiles she wept sore;
but all she could do she couldn’t wake him up. Next
morning, as soon as day broke, came the <i>Princess</i> with
the long nose, and drove her out again.</p>
<p>So in the daytime she sat down under the castle windows
and began to card with her carding-comb, and the
same thing happened. The <i>Princess</i> asked what she
wanted for it; and she said it wasn’t for sale for gold or
money, but if she might get leave to go up to the <i>Prince</i>
and be with him that night, the <i>Princess</i> should have it.
But when she went up she found him fast asleep again,
and all she called, and all she shook, and wept, and
prayed, she couldn’t get life into him; and as soon as the
first gray peep of day came, then came the <i>Princess</i> with
the long nose, and chased her out again.</p>
<p>So, in the daytime, the lassie sat down outside under
the castle window, and began to spin with her golden
spinning-wheel, and that, too, the <i>Princess</i> with the long
nose wanted to have. So she threw up the window and
asked what she wanted for it. The lassie said, as she had
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_25" name="page_25"></a>25</span>
said twice before, it wasn’t for sale for gold or money;
but if she might go up to the <i>Prince</i> who was there, and
be with him alone that night, she might have it.</p>
<p>Yes! she might do that and welcome. But now you
must know there were some Christian folk who had been
carried off thither, and as they sat in their room, which
was next the <i>Prince</i>, they had heard how a woman had
been in there, and wept and prayed, and called to him
two nights running, and they told that to the <i>Prince</i>.</p>
<p>That evening, when the <i>Princess</i> came with her sleepy
drink, the <i>Prince</i> made as if he drank, but threw it <a name="TC_1"></a><ins class="trchange" title="Was &#39;over over&#39;">over</ins>
his shoulder, for he could guess it was a sleepy drink.
So, when the lassie came in, she found the <i>Prince</i> wide
awake; and then she told him the whole story how she
had come thither.</p>
<p>“Ah,” said the <i>Prince</i>, “you’ve just come in the very
nick of time, for to-morrow is to be our wedding-day;
but now I won’t have the <i>Long-nose</i>, and you are the
only woman in the world who can set me free. I’ll say
I want to see what my wife is fit for, and beg her to wash
the shirt which has the three spots of tallow on it; she’ll
say yes, for she doesn’t know ’tis you who put them
there; but that’s a work only for Christian folk, and not
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_26" name="page_26"></a>26</span>
for such a pack of Trolls, and so I’ll say that I won’t
have any other for my bride than the woman who can
wash them out, and ask you to do it.”</p>
<p>So there was great joy and love between them all that
night. But next day, when the wedding was to be, the
<i>Prince</i> said:</p>
<p>“First of all, I’d like to see what my bride is fit for.”</p>
<p>“Yes!” said the step-mother, with all her heart.</p>
<p>“Well,” said the <i>Prince</i>, “I’ve got a fine shirt which
I’d like for my wedding shirt, but somehow or other it
has got three spots of tallow on it, which I must have
washed out; and I have sworn never to take any other
bride than the woman who’s able to do that. If she
can’t, she’s not worth having.”</p>
<p>Well, that was no great thing they said, so they
agreed, and she with the long-nose began to wash away
as hard as she could, but the more she rubbed and
scrubbed, the bigger the spots grew.</p>
<p>“Ah!” said the old hag, her mother, “you can’t
wash; let me try.”</p>
<p>But she hadn’t long taken the shirt in hand before it
got far worse than ever, and with all her rubbing, and
wringing, and scrubbing, the spots grew bigger and
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_27" name="page_27"></a>27</span>
blacker, and the darker and uglier was the shirt.</p>
<p>Then all the other Trolls began to wash, but the longer
it lasted, the blacker and uglier the shirt grew, till at last
it was as black all over as if it had been up the chimney.</p>
<p>“Ah!” said the <i>Prince</i>, “you’re none of you worth a
straw; you can’t wash. Why there, outside, sits a beggar
lassie, I’ll be bound she knows how to wash better than
the whole lot of you. <span class="smcap">Come in, Lassie!</span>” he shouted.</p>
<p>Well, in she came.</p>
<p>“Can you wash this shirt clean, lassie you?” said he.</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” she said, “but I think I can.”</p>
<p>And almost before she had taken it and dipped it in
the water, it was as white as driven snow, and whiter still.</p>
<p>“Yes; you are the lassie for me,” said the <i>Prince</i>.</p>
<p>At that the old hag flew into such a rage, she burst
on the spot, and the <i>Princess</i> with the long nose after
her, and the whole pack of Trolls after her—at least I’ve
never heard a word about them since.</p>
<p>As for the <i>Prince</i> and <i>Princess</i>, they set free all the
poor Christian folk who had been carried off and shut up
there; and they took with them all the silver and gold,
and flitted away as far as they could from the Castle that
lay <i>East of the Sun and West of the Moon</i>.</p>

<h2>THE BLUE BELT</h2>
</div>
<p><img class="dcap" src="./eastofthesunwestofthemoon_files/drop_o.png" alt="O" title="" width="75" height="73"><span class="smcap"><span class="dcap">O</span>nce</span> on a time there was an old beggar-woman,
who had gone out to beg. She had a little lad
with her, and when she had got her bag full
she struck across the hills towards her own home. So
when they had gone a bit up the hill-side, they came upon
a little <i>Blue Belt</i> which lay where two paths met, and the
lad asked his mother’s leave to pick it up.</p>
<p>“No,” said she, “maybe there’s witchcraft in it;”
and so with threats she forced him to follow her. But
when they had gone a bit further, the lad said he must
turn aside a moment out of the road; and meanwhile his
mother sat down on a tree-stump. But the lad was a long
time gone, for as soon as he got so far into the wood that
the old dame could not see him, he ran off to where the
<i>Belt</i> lay, took it up, tied it round his waist, and lo! he
felt as strong as if he could lift the whole hill. When he
got back, the old dame was in a great rage, and wanted to
know what he had been doing all that while. “You don’t
care how much time you waste, and yet you know the
night is drawing on, and we must cross the hill before it is
dark!” So on they tramped; but when they had got
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_30" name="page_30"></a>30</span>
about half-way, the old dame grew weary, and said she
must rest under a bush.</p>
<p>“Dear mother,” said the lad, “mayn’t I just go up to
the top of this high crag while you rest, and try if I can’t
see some sign of folk hereabouts?”</p>
<p>Yes! he might do that; so when he had got to the top
he saw a light shining from the north. So he ran down
and told his mother.</p>
<p>“We must get on, mother; we are near a house, for I
see a bright light shining quite close to us in the north.”
Then she rose and shouldered her bag, and set off to see;
but they hadn’t gone far, before there stood a steep spur
of the hill, right across their path.</p>
<p>“Just as I thought!” said the old dame, “now we can’t
go a step farther; a pretty bed we shall have here!”</p>
<p>But the lad took the bag under one arm, and his
mother under the other, and ran straight up the steep crag
with them.</p>
<p>“Now, don’t you see? Don’t you see that we are
close to a house? Don’t you see that bright light?”</p>
<p>But the old dame said those were no Christian folk,
but <i>Trolls</i>, for she was at home in all that forest far and
near, and knew there was not a living soul in it, until
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_31" name="page_31"></a>31</span>
you were well over the ridge and had come down on the
other side. But they went on, and in a little while they
came to a great house which was all painted red.</p>
<p>“What’s the good?” said the old dame. “We daren’t
go in, for here the <i>Trolls</i> live.”</p>
<p>“Don’t say so; we must go in. There must be men
where the lights shine so,” said the lad. So in he went,
and his mother after him, but he had scarce opened the
door before she swooned away, for there she saw a great
stout man, at least twenty feet high, sitting on the bench.</p>
<p>“Good evening, grandfather!” said the lad.</p>
<p>“Well, here I’ve sat three hundred years,” said the
man who sat on the bench, “and no one has ever come
and called me grandfather before.” Then the lad sat down
by the man’s side, and began to talk to him as if they had
been old friends.</p>
<p>“But what’s come over your mother?” said the man,
after they had chatted a while. “I think she swooned
away; you had better look after her.”</p>
<p>So the lad went and took hold of the old dame, and
dragged her up the hall along the floor. That brought
her to herself, and she kicked and scratched, and flung
herself about, and at last sat down upon a heap of firewood
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_32" name="page_32"></a>32</span>
in the corner; but she was so frightened that she scarce
dared to look one in the face.</p>
<p>After a while, the lad asked if they could spend the
night there.</p>
<p>“Yes, to be sure,” said the man.</p>
<p>So they went on talking again, but the lad soon got
hungry, and wanted to know if they could get food as
well as lodging.</p>
<p>“Of course,” said the man, “that might be got too.”
And after he had sat a while longer, he rose up and threw
six loads of dry pitch-pine on the fire. This made the
old hag still more afraid.</p>
<p>“Oh! now he’s going to roast us alive,” she said, in
the corner where she sat.</p>
<p>And when the wood had burned down to glowing
embers, up got the man and strode out of his house.</p>
<p>“Heaven bless and help us! what a stout heart you
have got!” said the old dame. “Don’t you see we have
got amongst <i>Trolls</i>?”</p>
<p>“Stuff and nonsense!” said the lad; “no harm if we
have.”</p>
<p>In a little while, back came the man with an ox so fat
and big, the lad had never seen its like, and he gave it
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_33" name="page_33"></a>33</span>
one blow with his fist under the ear, and down it fell dead
on the floor. When that was done, he took it up by all
the four legs and laid it on the glowing embers, and turned
it and twisted it about till it was burnt brown outside.
After that, he went to a cupboard and took out a great
silver dish, and laid the ox on it; and the dish was so
big that none of the ox hung over on any side. This
he put on the table, and then he went down into the
cellar and fetched a cask of wine, knocked out the head,
and put the cask on the table, together with two knives,
which were each six feet long. When this was done he
bade them go and sit down to supper and eat. So they
went, the lad first and the old dame after, but she began
to whimper and wail, and to wonder how she should ever
use such knives. But her son seized one, and began to
cut slices out of the thigh of the ox, which he placed
before his mother. And when they had eaten a bit, he
took up the cask with both hands, and lifted it down to
the floor; then he told his mother to come and drink,
but it was still so high she couldn’t reach up to it; so
he caught her up, and held her up to the edge of the cask
while she drank; as for himself, he clambered up and
hung down like a cat inside the cask while he drank. So
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_34" name="page_34"></a>34</span>
when he had quenched his thirst, he took up the cask and
put it back on the table, and thanked the man for the
good meal, and told his mother to come and thank him
too, and, a-feared though she was, she dared do nothing
else but thank the man. Then the lad sat down again
alongside the man and began to gossip, and after they had
sat a while the man said:</p>
<p>“Well! I must just go and get a bit of supper too;”
and so he went to the table and ate up the whole ox—hoofs,
and horns, and all—and drained the cask to the
last drop, and then went back and sat on the bench.</p>
<p>“As for beds,” he said, “I don’t know what’s to be
done. I’ve only got one bed and a cradle; but we could
get on pretty well if you would sleep in the cradle, and
then your mother might lie in the bed yonder.”</p>
<p>“Thank you kindly, that’ll do nicely,” said the lad;
and with that he pulled off his clothes and lay down in
the cradle; but, to tell you the truth, it was quite as big
as a four-poster. As for the old dame, she had to follow
the man who showed her to bed, though she was out of
her wits for fear.</p>
<p>“Well!” thought the lad to himself, “’twill never do
to go to sleep yet. I’d best lie awake and listen how
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_35" name="page_35"></a>35</span>
things go as the night wears on.”</p>
<p>So, after a while, the man began to talk to the old
dame, and at last he said:</p>
<p>“We two might live here so happily together, could
we only be rid of this son of yours.”</p>
<p>“But do you know how to settle him? Is that what
you’re thinking of?” said she.</p>
<p>“Nothing easier,” said he; at any rate he would try.
He would just say he wished the old dame would stay
and keep house for him a day or two, and then he would
take the lad out with him up the hill to quarry corner-stones,
and roll down a great rock on him. All this the
lad lay and listened to.</p>
<p>Next day the <i>Troll</i>—for it was a <i>Troll</i> as clear as
day—asked if the old dame would stay and keep house
for him a few days; and as the day went on he took a
great iron crowbar, and asked the lad if he had a mind
to go with him up the hill and quarry a few corner-stones.
With all his heart, he said, and went with him; and so,
after they had split a few stones, the <i>Troll</i> wanted him
to go down below and look after cracks in the rock;
and while he was doing this the <i>Troll</i> worked away, and
wearied himself with his crowbar till he moved a whole
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_36" name="page_36"></a>36</span>
crag out of its bed, which came rolling right down on the
place where the lad was; but he held it up till he could
get on one side, and then let it roll on.</p>
<p>“Oh!” said the lad to the <i>Troll</i>, “now I see what you
mean to do with me. You want to crush me to death;
so just go down yourself and look after the cracks and
refts in the rock, and I’ll stand up above.”</p>
<p>The <i>Troll</i> did not dare to do otherwise than the lad
bade him, and the end of it was that the lad rolled down
a great rock, which fell upon the <i>Troll</i> and broke one of
his thighs.</p>
<p>“Well! you <i>are</i> in a sad plight,” said the lad, as he
strode down, lifted up the rock, and set the man free.
After that he had to put him on his back and carry him
home; so he ran with him as fast as a horse, and shook
him so that the <i>Troll</i> screamed and screeched as if a knife
were run into him. And when he got home, they had to
put the <i>Troll</i> to bed, and there he lay in a sad pickle.</p>
<p>When the night wore on, the <i>Troll</i> began to talk to
the old dame again, and to wonder how ever they could
be rid of the lad.</p>
<p>“Well,” said the old dame, “if you can’t hit on a
plan to get rid of him, I’m sure I can’t.”</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_37" name="page_37"></a>37</span></div>
<p>“Let me see,” said the <i>Troll</i>; “I’ve got twelve lions
in a garden; if they could only get hold of the lad, they’d
soon tear him to pieces.”</p>
<p>So the old dame said it would be easy enough to get
him there. She would sham sick, and say she felt so poorly,
nothing would do her any good but lion’s milk. All that
the lad lay and listened to; and when he got up in the
morning his mother said she was worse than she looked,
and she thought she should never be right again unless she
could get some lion’s milk.</p>
<p>“Then I’m afraid you’ll be poorly a long time, mother,”
said the lad, “for I’m sure I don’t know where any is to
be got.”</p>
<p>“Oh! if that be all,” said the <i>Troll</i>, “there’s no lack
of lion’s milk, if we only had the man to fetch it;” and
then he went on to say how his brother had a garden with
twelve lions in it, and how the lad might have the key if he
had a mind to milk the lions. So the lad took the key and
a milking pail, and strode off; and when he unlocked the
gate and got into the garden, there stood all the twelve
lions on their hind-paws, rampant and roaring at him. But
the lad laid hold of the biggest, and led him about by the
fore-paws, and dashed him against stocks and stones till
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_38" name="page_38"></a>38</span>
there wasn’t a bit of him left but the two paws. So when
the rest saw that, they were so afraid that they crept up and
lay at his feet like so many curs. After that they followed
him about wherever he went, and when he got home, they
lay down outside the house, with their fore-paws on the
door sill.</p>
<p>“Now, mother, you’ll soon be well,” said the lad, when
he went in, “for here is the lion’s milk.”</p>
<p>He had just milked a drop in the pail.</p>
<p>But the <a name="TC_2"></a><ins class="trchange" title="Added italics"><i>Troll</i></ins>, as he lay in bed, swore it was all a
lie. He was sure the lad was not the man to milk lions.</p>
<p>When the lad heard that, he forced the <i>Troll</i> to get
out of bed, threw open the door, and all the lions rose
up and seized the <i>Troll</i>, and at last the lad had to make
them leave their hold.</p>
<p>That night the <i>Troll</i> began to talk to the old dame
again. “I’m sure I can’t tell how to put this lad out of
the way—he is so awfully strong; can’t you think of
some way?”</p>
<p>“No,” said the old dame, “if you can’t tell, I’m sure
I can’t.”</p>
<p>“Well!” said the <i>Troll</i>, “I have two brothers in a
castle; they are twelve times as strong as I am, and that’s
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_39" name="page_39"></a>39</span>
why I was turned out and had to put up with this farm.
They hold that castle, and round it there is an orchard
with apples in it, and whoever eats those apples sleeps
for three days and three nights. If we could only get
the lad to go for the fruit, he wouldn’t be able to keep
from tasting the apples, and as soon as ever he fell asleep
my brothers would tear him in pieces.”</p>
<p>The old dame said she would sham sick, and say she
could never be herself again unless she tasted those apples;
for she had set her heart on them.</p>
<p>All this the lad lay and listened to.</p>
<p>When the morning came the old dame was so poorly
that she couldn’t utter a word but groans and sighs. She
was sure she should never be well again, unless she had
some of those apples that grew in the orchard near the
castle where the man’s brothers lived; only she had no
one to send for them.</p>
<p>Oh! the lad was ready to go that instant; but the
eleven lions went with him. So when he came to the
orchard, he climbed up into the apple tree and ate as
many apples as he could, and he had scarce got down
before he fell into a deep sleep; but the lions all lay
round him in a ring. The third day came the <i>Troll’s</i>
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_40" name="page_40"></a>40</span>
brothers, but they did not come in man’s shape. They
came snorting like man-eating steeds, and wondered who
it was that dared to be there, and said they would tear
him to pieces, so small that there should not be a bit
of him left. But up rose the lions and tore the <i>Trolls</i>
into small pieces, so that the place looked as if a dung
heap had been tossed about it; and when they had
finished the <i>Trolls</i> they lay down again. The lad did
not wake till late in the afternoon, and when he got on
his knees and rubbed the sleep out of his eyes, he began
to wonder what had been going on, when he saw the
marks of hoofs. But when he went towards the castle,
a maiden looked out of a window who had seen all that
had happened, and she said:</p>
<p>“You may thank your stars you weren’t in that
tussle, else you must have lost your life.”</p>
<p>“What! I lose my life! No fear of that, I think,”
said the lad.</p>
<p>So she begged him to come in, that she might talk
with him, for she hadn’t seen a Christian soul ever since
she came there. But when she opened the door the
lions wanted to go in too, but she got so frightened that
she began to scream, and so the lad let them lie outside.
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_41" name="page_41"></a>41</span>
Then the two talked and talked, and the lad asked how
it came that she, who was so lovely, could put up with those
ugly <i>Trolls</i>. She never wished it, she said; ’twas quite
against her will. They had seized her by force, and she
was the King of Arabia’s daughter. So they talked on, and
at last she asked him what he would do; whether she
should go back home, or whether he would have her to
wife. Of course he would have her, and she shouldn’t go
home.</p>
<p>After that they went round the castle, and at last they
came to a great hall, where the <i>Trolls’</i> two great swords
hung high up on the wall.</p>
<p>“I wonder if you are man enough to wield one of
these,” said the <i>Princess</i>.</p>
<p>“Who? I?” said the lad. “’Twould be a pretty
thing if I couldn’t wield one of these.”</p>
<p>With that he put two or three chairs one a-top of the
other, jumped up, and touched the biggest sword with his
finger tips, tossed it up in the air, and caught it again by
the hilt; leapt down, and at the same time dealt such a
blow with it on the floor that the whole hall shook. After
he had thus got down, he thrust the sword under his arm
and carried it about with him.</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_42" name="page_42"></a>42</span></div>
<p>So, when they had lived a little while in the castle, the
<i>Princess</i> thought she ought to go home to her parents, and
let them know what had become of her; so they loaded a
ship, and she set sail from the castle.</p>
<p>After she had gone, and the lad had wandered about a
little, he called to mind that he had been sent out on an
errand thither, and had come to fetch something for his
mother’s health; and though he said to himself, “After all
the old dame was not so bad but she’s all right by this
time”—still he thought he ought to go and just see how
she was. So he went and found both the man and his
mother quite fresh and hearty.</p>
<p>“What wretches you are to live in this beggarly hut,”
said the lad. “Come with me up to my castle, and you
shall see what a fine fellow I am.”</p>
<p>Well! they were both ready to go, and on the way his
mother talked to him, and asked how it was he had got
so strong.</p>
<p>“If you must know it came of that blue belt which lay
on the hill-side that time when you and I were out begging,”
said the lad.</p>
<p>“Have you got it still?” asked she.</p>
<p>“Yes”—he had. It was tied round his waist.</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_43" name="page_43"></a>43</span></div>
<p>“Might she see it?”</p>
<p>“Yes”—she might; and with that he pulled open his
waistcoat and shirt to show <a name="TC_3"></a><ins class="trchange" title="Added &#39;to&#39;: Was &#39;it her&#39;">it to her</ins>.</p>
<p>Then she seized it with both hands, tore it off, and
twisted it round her fist.</p>
<p>“Now,” she cried, “what shall I do with such a wretch
as you? I’ll just give you one blow, and dash your brains
out!”</p>
<p>“Far too good a death for such a scamp,” said the
<i>Troll</i>. “No! let’s first burn out his eyes, and then turn
him adrift in a little boat.”</p>
<p>So they burned out his eyes and turned him adrift, in
spite of his prayers and tears; but, as the boat drifted, the
lions swam after, and at last they laid hold of it and dragged
it ashore on an island, and placed the lad under a fir tree.
They caught game for him, and they plucked the birds and
made him a bed of down; but he was forced to eat his meat
raw and he was blind. At last, one day the biggest lion was
chasing a hare which was blind, for it ran straight over stock
and stone, and the end was, it ran right up against a fir-stump
and tumbled head over heels across the field right
into a spring; but lo! when it came out of the spring it saw
its way quite plain, and so saved its life.</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_44" name="page_44"></a>44</span></div>
<p>“So, so!” thought the lion, and went and dragged the
lad to the spring, and dipped him over head and ears in it.
So, when he had got his sight again, he went down to the
shore and made signs to the lions that they should all lie
close together like a raft; then he stood upon their backs
while they swam with him to the mainland. When he had
reached the shore he went up into a birchen copse, and
made the lions lie quiet. Then he stole up to the castle,
like a thief, to see if he couldn’t lay hands on his belt; and
when he got to the door, he peeped through the keyhole,
and there he saw his belt hanging up over a door in the kitchen.
So he crept softly in across the floor, for there was
no one there; but as soon as he had got hold of the belt, he
began to kick and stamp about as though he were mad. Just
then his mother came rushing out:</p>
<p>“Dear heart, my darling little boy! do give me the belt
again,” she said.</p>
<p>“Thank you kindly,” said he. “Now you shall have
the doom you passed on me,” and he fulfilled it on the spot.
When the old <i>Troll</i> heard that, he came in and begged and
prayed so prettily that he might not be smitten to death.</p>
<p>“Well, you may live,” said the lad, “but you shall
undergo the same punishment you gave me;” and so he
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_45" name="page_45"></a>45</span>
burned out the <i>Troll’s</i> eyes, and turned him adrift on the
sea in a little boat, but he had no lions to follow him.</p>
<p>Now the lad was all alone, and he went about longing
and longing for the <i>Princess</i>; at last he could bear it no
longer; he must set out to seek her, his heart was so bent on
having her. So he loaded four ships and set sail for Arabia.</p>
<p>For some time they had fair wind and fine weather, but
after that they lay wind-bound under a rocky island. So
the sailors went ashore and strolled about to spend the time,
and there they found a huge egg, almost as big as a little
house. So they began to knock it about with large stones,
but, after all, they couldn’t crack the shell. Then the lad
came up with his sword to see what all the noise was about,
and when he saw the egg, he thought it a trifle to crack it;
so he gave it one blow and the egg split, and out came a
chicken as big as an elephant.</p>
<p>“Now we have done wrong,” said the lad; “this can
cost us all our lives;” and then he asked his sailors if they
were men enough to sail to Arabia in four-and-twenty
hours if they got a fine breeze. Yes! they were good to
do that, they said, so they set sail with a fine breeze, and
got to Arabia in three-and-twenty hours. As soon as
they landed, the lad ordered all the sailors to go and bury
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_46" name="page_46"></a>46</span>
themselves up to the eyes in a sandhill, so that they could
barely see the ships. The lad and the captains climbed
a high crag and sate down under a fir.</p>
<p>In a little while came a great bird flying with an island
in its claws, and let it fall down on the fleet, and sunk every
ship. After it had done that, it flew up to the sandhill and
flapped its wings, so that the wind nearly took off the heads
of the sailors, and it flew past the fir with such force that it
turned the lad right about, but he was ready with his sword,
and gave the bird one blow and brought it down dead.</p>
<p>After that he went to the town, where every one was
glad because the <i>King</i> had got his daughter back; but now
the <i>King</i> had hidden her away somewhere himself, and
promised her hand as a reward to any one who could find
her, and this though she was betrothed before. Now as
the lad went along he met a man who had white bear-skins
for sale, so he bought one of the hides and put it on; and
one of the captains was to take an iron chain and lead him
about, and so he went into the town and began to play
pranks. At last the news came to the <i>King’s</i> ears, that
there never had been such fun in the town before, for here
was a white bear that danced and cut capers just as it was
bid. So a messenger came to say the bear must come to
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_47" name="page_47"></a>47</span>
the castle at once, for the <i>King</i> wanted to see its tricks. So
when it got to the castle every one was afraid, for such a
beast they had never seen before; but the captain said there
was no danger unless they laughed at it. They mustn’t
do that, else it would tear them to pieces. When the
<i>King</i> heard that, he warned all the court not to laugh.
But while the fun was going on, in came one of the <i>King’s</i>
maids, and began to laugh and make game of the bear, and
the bear flew at her and tore her, so that there was scarce a
rag of her left. Then all the court began to bewail, and
the captain most of all.</p>

</div>
<p>“Stuff and nonsense,” said the <i>King</i>; “she’s only a
maid, besides it’s more my affair than yours.”</p>
<p>When the show was over, it was late at night. “It’s
no good your going away, when it’s so late,” said the <i>King</i>.
“The bear had best sleep here.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps it might sleep in the ingle by the kitchen
fire,” said the captain.</p>
<p>“Nay,” said the <i>King</i>, “it shall sleep up here, and it
shall have pillows and cushions to sleep on.” So a whole
heap of pillows and cushions was brought, and the captain
had a bed in a side room.</p>
<p>But at midnight the <i>King</i> came with a lamp in his hand
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_48" name="page_48"></a>48</span>
and a big bunch of
keys, and carried
off the white bear.
He passed along
gallery after gallery
through
doors and rooms,
up-stairs and
down-stairs, till at
last he came to a
pier which ran out
into the sea. Then
the <i>King</i> began to
pull and haul at
posts and pins, this one up and that one down, till at last
a little house floated up to the water’s edge. There he
kept his daughter, for she was so dear to him that he had
hid her, so that no one could find her out. He left the
white bear outside while he went in and told her how it had
danced and played its pranks. She said she was afraid, and
dared not look at it; but he talked her over, saying there
was no danger if she only wouldn’t laugh. So they brought
the bear in, and locked the door, and it danced and played
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_49" name="page_49"></a>49</span>
its tricks; but just when the fun was at its height, the
<i>Princess’s</i> maid began to laugh. Then the lad flew at her
and tore her to bits, and the <i>Princess</i> began to cry and sob.</p>
<p>“Stuff and nonsense,” cried the <i>King</i>; “all this fuss
about a maid! I’ll get you just as good a one again. But
now I think the bear had best stay here till morning, for
I don’t care to have to go and lead it along all those
galleries and stairs at this time of night.”</p>
<p>“Well!” said the <i>Princess</i>, “if it sleeps here, I’m
sure I won’t.”</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>But just then the bear curled himself up and lay
down by the stove; and it was settled at last that the
<i>Princess</i> should sleep there too, with a light burning.
But as soon as the <i>King</i> had well gone, the white bear
came and begged her to undo his collar. The <i>Princess</i>
was so scared she almost swooned away; but she felt
about till she found the collar, and she had scarce undone
it before the bear pulled his head off. Then she knew
him again, and was so glad there was no end to her joy,
and she wanted to tell her father at once that her deliverer
was come. But the lad would not hear of it; he would
earn her once more, he said. So in the morning when
they heard the <i>King</i> rattling at the posts outside, the
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_50" name="page_50"></a>50</span>
lad drew on the hide and lay down by the stove.</p>
<p>“Well, has it lain still?” the king asked.</p>
<p>“I should think so,” said the <i>Princess</i>; “it hasn’t so
much as turned or stretched itself once.”</p>
<p>When they got up to the castle again, the captain took
the bear and led it away, and then the lad threw off the
hide, and went to a tailor and ordered clothes fit for a
prince; and when they were fitted on he went to the <i>King</i>,
and said he wanted to find the <i>Princess</i>.</p>

<p>“You’re not
the first who has
wished the same
thing,” said the
<i>King</i>, “but they
have all lost their
lives; for if any
one who tries can’t
find her in four-and-twenty
hours
his life is forfeited.”</p>
<p>Yes; the lad
knew all that. Still
he wished to try,
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_51" name="page_51"></a>51</span>
and if he couldn’t find her, ’twas his look-out. Now in the
castle there was a band that played sweet tunes, and there
were fair maids to dance with, and so the lad danced away.</p>
<p>When twelve hours were gone, the <i>King</i> said:</p>
<p>“I pity you with all my heart. You’re so poor a hand
at seeking; you will surely lose your life.”</p>
<p>“Stuff!” said the lad; “while there’s life there’s hope!
So long as there’s breath in the body there’s no fear; we
have lots of time!” and so he went on dancing till there was
only one hour left.</p>
<p>Then he said he would begin to search.</p>
<p>“It’s no use now,” said the <i>King</i>; “time’s up.”</p>
<p>“Light your lamp; out with your big bunch of keys,”
said the lad, “and follow me whither I wish to go. There
is still a whole hour left.”</p>
<p>So the lad went the same way which the <i>King</i> had led
him the night before, and he bade the <i>King</i> unlock door
after door till they came down to the pier which ran out
into the sea.</p>
<p>“It’s all no use, I tell you,” said the <i>King</i>; “time’s
up, and this will only lead you right out into the sea.”</p>
<p>“Still five minutes more,” said the lad, as he pulled
and pushed at the posts and pins, and the house floated up.</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_52" name="page_52"></a>52</span></div>
<p>“Now the time is up,” bawled the <i>King</i>; “come
hither, headsman, and take off his head.”</p>
<p>“Nay, nay!” said the lad; “stop a bit, there are still
three minutes! Out with the key, and let me get into this
house.”</p>
<p>But there stood the <i>King</i> and fumbled with his keys, to
draw out the time. At last he said he hadn’t any key.</p>
<p>“Well, if you haven’t, I <i>have</i>,” said the lad, as he gave
the door such a kick that it flew to splinters inwards on the
floor.</p>
<p>At the door the <i>Princess</i> met him, and told her father
this was her deliverer, on whom her heart was set. So she
had him; and this was how the beggar boy came to marry
the daughter of the King of Arabia.</p>

<h2>PRINCE LINDWORM</h2>
</div>
<p><img class="dcap" src="./eastofthesunwestofthemoon_files/drop_o.png" alt="O" title="" width="75" height="73"><span class="smcap"><span class="dcap">O</span>nce</span> upon a time, there was a fine young <i>King</i>
who was married to the loveliest of Queens.
They were exceedingly happy, all but for one
thing—they had no children. And this often made them
both sad, because the <i>Queen</i> wanted a dear little child to
play with, and the <i>King</i> wanted an heir to the kingdom.</p>
<p>One day the <i>Queen</i> went out for a walk by herself,
and she met an ugly old woman. The old woman was
just like a witch: but she was a nice kind of witch, not
the cantankerous sort. She said, “Why do you look so
doleful, pretty lady?” “It’s no use my telling you,”
answered the <i>Queen</i>, “nobody in the world can help me.”
“Oh, you never know,” said the old woman. “Just you
let me hear what your trouble is, and maybe I can put
things right.”</p>
<p>“My dear woman, how can you?” said the <i>Queen</i>:
and she told her, “The <i>King</i> and I have no children:
that’s why I am so distressed.” “Well, you needn’t be,”
said the old witch. “I can set that right in a twinkling,
if only you will do exactly as I tell you. Listen. To-night,
at sunset, take a little drinking-cup with two ears”
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_54" name="page_54"></a>54</span>
(that is, handles), “and put it bottom upwards on the
ground in the north-west corner of your garden. Then
go and lift it up to-morrow morning at sunrise, and you
will find two roses underneath it, one red and one white.
If you eat the red rose, a little boy will be born to you:
if you eat the white rose, a little girl will be sent. But,
whatever you do, you mustn’t eat <i>both</i> the roses, or
you’ll be sorry,—that I warn you! Only one: remember
that!” “Thank you a thousand times,” said the <i>Queen</i>,
“this is good news
indeed!” And she
wanted to give the
old woman her
gold ring; but
the old woman
wouldn’t take it.</p>
<div class="figtag">
<a name="linki_16" id="linki_16"></a>
</div>
<div class="figright" style="width:250px">
<img src="./eastofthesunwestofthemoon_files/gs06.png" alt="" title="" width="250" height="279"><br>
</div>
<p>So the <i>Queen</i>
went home and did
as she had been
told: and next
morning at sunrise
she stole out into
the garden and
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_55" name="page_55"></a>55</span>
lifted up the little drinking-cup. She <i>was</i> surprised, for
indeed she had hardly expected to see anything. But
there were the two roses underneath it, one red and one
white. And now she was dreadfully puzzled, for she did
not know which to choose. “If I choose the red one,”
she thought, “and I have a little boy, he may grow up
and go to the wars and get killed. But if I choose the
white one, and have a little girl, she will stay at home
awhile with us, but later on she will get married and go
away and leave us. So, whichever it is, we may be left
with no child after all.”</p>
<p>However, at last she decided on the white rose, and
she ate it. And it tasted so sweet, that she took and ate
the red one too: without ever remembering the old
woman’s solemn warning.</p>
<p>Some time after this, the <a name="TC_4"></a><ins class="trchange" title="Added italics"><i>King</i></ins> went away to the wars:
and while he was still away, the <i>Queen</i> became the mother
of twins. One was a lovely baby-boy, and the other was
a <i>Lindworm</i>, or Serpent. She was terribly frightened
when she saw the <i>Lindworm</i>, but he wriggled away out
of the room, and nobody seemed to have seen him but
herself: so that she thought it must have been a dream.
The baby <i>Prince</i> was so beautiful and so healthy, the
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_56" name="page_56"></a>56</span>
<i>Queen</i> was full of joy: and likewise, as you may suppose,
was the <i>King</i> when he came home and found his son and
heir. Not a word was said by anyone about the <i>Lindworm</i>:
only the <i>Queen</i> thought about it now and then.</p>
<p>Many days and years passed by, and the baby grew up
into a handsome young <i>Prince</i>, and it was time that he
got married. The <i>King</i> sent him off to visit foreign
kingdoms, in the Royal coach, with six white horses, to
look for a Princess grand enough to be his wife. But
at the very first cross-roads, the way was stopped by an
enormous <i>Lindworm</i>, enough to frighten the bravest. He
lay in the middle of the road with a great wide open
mouth, and cried, “A bride for me before a bride for
you!” Then the <i>Prince</i> made the coach turn round and
try another road: but it was all no use. For, at the
first cross-ways, there lay the <i>Lindworm</i> again, crying
out, “A bride for me before a bride for you!” So the
<i>Prince</i> had to turn back home again to the Castle, and
give up his visits to the foreign kingdoms. And his
mother, the <i>Queen</i>, had to confess that what the <i>Lindworm</i>
said was true. For he was really the eldest of her twins:
and so he ought to have a wedding first.</p>
<p>There seemed nothing for it but to find a bride for the
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_57" name="page_57"></a>57</span>
<i>Lindworm</i>, if his younger brother, the <i>Prince</i>, were to be
married at all. So the <i>King</i> wrote to a distant country,
and asked for a Princess to marry his son (but, of course,
he didn’t say which son), and presently a Princess arrived.
But she wasn’t allowed to see her bridegroom until he
stood by her side in the great hall and was married to
her, and then, of course, it was too late for her to say she
wouldn’t have him. But next morning the Princess had
disappeared. The <i>Lindworm</i> lay sleeping all alone: and
it was quite plain that he had eaten her.</p>
<p>A little while after, the Prince decided that he might
now go journeying again in search of a <i>Princess</i>. And
off he drove in the Royal chariot with the six white
horses. But at the first cross-ways, there lay the <i>Lindworm</i>,
crying with his great wide open mouth, “A bride
for me before a bride for you!” So the carriage tried
another road, and the same thing happened, and they had
to turn back again this time, just as formerly. And the
King wrote to several foreign countries, to know if anyone
would marry his son. At last another <i>Princess</i> arrived,
this time from a very far distant land. And, of course,
she was not allowed to see her future husband before the
wedding took place,—and then, lo and behold! it was
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_58" name="page_58"></a>58</span>
the <i>Lindworm</i> who stood at her side. And next morning
the Princess had disappeared: and the <i>Lindworm</i> lay
sleeping all alone; and it was quite clear that he had
eaten her.</p>
<p>By and by the <i>Prince</i> started on his quest for the third
time: and at the first cross-roads there lay the <i>Lindworm</i>
with his great wide open mouth, demanding a bride as
before. And the <i>Prince</i> went straight back to the castle,
and told the <i>King</i>: “You must find another bride for
my elder brother.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know where I am to find her,” said the <i>King</i>,
“I have already made enemies of two great Kings who
sent their daughters here as brides: and I have no notion
how I can obtain a third lady. People are beginning to
say strange things, and I am sure no <i>Princess</i> will dare to
come.”</p>
<p>Now, down in a little cottage near a wood, there lived
the <i>King’s</i> shepherd, an old man with his only daughter.
And the <i>King</i> came one day and said to him, “Will you
give me your daughter to marry my son the <i>Lindworm</i>?
And I will make you rich for the rest of your life.”—“No,
sire,” said the shepherd, “that I cannot do. She
is my only child, and I want her to take care of me when
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_59" name="page_59"></a>59</span>
I am old. Besides, if the <i>Lindworm</i> would not spare two
beautiful Princesses, he won’t spare her either. He will
just gobble her up: and she is much too good for such
a fate.”</p>
<p>But the <i>King</i> wouldn’t take “No” for an answer: and
at last the old man had to give in.</p>
<p>Well, when the old shepherd told his daughter that
she was to be <i>Prince Lindworm’s</i> bride, she was utterly
in despair. She went out into the woods, crying and
wringing her hands and bewailing her hard fate. And
while she wandered to and fro, an old witch-woman
suddenly appeared out of a big hollow oak-tree, and
asked her, “Why do you look so doleful, pretty lass?”
The shepherd-girl said, “It’s no use my telling you, for
nobody in the world can help me.”—“Oh, you never
know,” said the old woman. “Just you let me hear what
your trouble is, and maybe I can put things right.”—“Ah,
how can you?” said the girl, “For I am to be
married to the <i>King’s</i> eldest son, who is a <i>Lindworm</i>.
He has already married two beautiful Princesses, and
devoured them: and he will eat me too! No wonder I
am distressed.”</p>
<p>“Well, you needn’t be,” said the <a name="TC_5"></a><ins class="trchange" title="Standardised hyphenation from &#39;witchwoman&#39;">witch-woman</ins>. “All
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_60" name="page_60"></a>60</span>
that can be set right in a twinkling: if only you will do
exactly as I tell you.” So the girl said she would.</p>
<p>“Listen, then,” said the old woman. “After the
marriage ceremony is over, and when it is time for you to
retire to rest, you must ask to be dressed in ten snow-white
shifts. And you must then ask for a tub full of lye,”
(that is, washing water prepared with wood-ashes) “and
a tub full of fresh milk, and as many whips as a boy can
carry in his arms,—and have all these brought into your
bed-chamber. Then, when the <i>Lindworm</i> tells you to
shed a shift, do you bid him slough a skin. And when
all his skins are off, you must dip the whips in the lye
and whip him; next, you must wash him in the fresh
milk; and, lastly, you must take him and hold him in
your arms, if it’s only for one moment.”</p>
<p>“The last is the worst notion—ugh!” said the shepherd’s
daughter, and she shuddered at the thought of
holding the cold, slimy, scaly <i>Lindworm</i>.</p>
<p>“Do just as I have said, and all will go well,” said
the old woman. Then she disappeared again in the oak-tree.</p>
<p>When the wedding-day arrived, the girl was fetched
in the Royal chariot with the six white horses, and taken
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_61" name="page_61"></a>61</span>
to the castle to be decked as a bride. And she asked
for ten snow-white shifts to be brought her, and the tub
of lye, and the tub of milk, and as many whips as a boy
could carry in his arms. The ladies and courtiers in the
castle thought, of course, that this was some bit of peasant
superstition, all rubbish and nonsense. But the <i>King</i>
said, “Let her have whatever she asks for.” She was
then arrayed in the most wonderful robes, and looked
the loveliest of brides. She was led to the hall where
the wedding ceremony was to take place, and she saw
the <i>Lindworm</i> for the first time as he came in and stood
by her side. So they were married, and a great wedding-feast
was held, a banquet fit for the son of a king.</p>

<p class="caption">
<i>She saw the Lindworm for the first time as he came in and stood by her side.</i><br>
</p>
</div>
<p>When the feast was over, the bridegroom and bride
were conducted to their apartment, with music, and
torches, and a great procession. As soon as the door
was shut, the <i>Lindworm</i> turned to her and said, “Fair
maiden, shed a shift!” The shepherd’s daughter
answered him, “<i>Prince Lindworm</i>, slough a skin!”—“No
one has ever dared tell me to do that before!” said
he.—“But I command you to do it now!” said she.
Then he began to moan and wriggle: and in a few
minutes a long snake-skin lay upon the floor beside him.
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_62" name="page_62"></a>62</span>
The girl drew off her first shift, and spread it on top of
the skin.</p>
<p>The <i>Lindworm</i> said again to her, “Fair maiden, shed
a shift.”</p>
<p>The shepherd’s daughter answered him, “<i>Prince
Lindworm</i>, slough a skin.”</p>
<p>“No one has ever dared tell me to do that before,”
said he.—“But I command you to do it now,” said she.
Then with groans and moans he cast off the second skin:
and she covered it with her second shift. The <i>Lindworm</i>
said for the third time, “Fair maiden, shed a shift.” The
shepherd’s daughter answered him again, “<i>Prince Lindworm</i>,
slough a skin.”—“No one has ever dared tell me
to do that before,” said he, and his little eyes rolled
furiously. But the girl was not afraid, and once more
she commanded him to do as she bade.</p>
<p>And so this went on until nine <i>Lindworm</i> skins were
lying on the floor, each of them covered with a snow-white
shift. And there was nothing left of the <i>Lindworm</i>
but a huge thick mass, most horrible to see. Then the
girl seized the whips, dipped them in the lye, and
whipped him as hard as ever she could. Next, she
bathed him all over in the fresh milk. Lastly, she dragged
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_63" name="page_63"></a>63</span>
him on to the bed and put her arms round him. And
she fell fast asleep that very moment.</p>
<p>Next morning very early, the <i>King</i> and the courtiers
came and peeped in through the keyhole. They wanted
to know what had become of the girl, but none of them
dared enter the room. However, in the end, growing
bolder, they opened the door a tiny bit. And there they
saw the girl, all fresh and rosy, and beside her lay—no
<i>Lindworm</i>, but the handsomest prince that any one could
wish to see.</p>
<p>The <i>King</i> ran out and fetched the <i>Queen</i>: and after
that, there were such rejoicings in the castle as never
were known before or since. The wedding took place
all over again, much finer than the first, with festivals
and banquets and merrymakings for days and weeks. No
bride was ever so beloved by a King and Queen as this
peasant maid from the shepherd’s cottage. There was
no end to their love and their kindness towards her:
because, by her sense and her calmness and her courage,
she had saved their son, <i>Prince Lindworm</i>.</p>

in a great wood. The wife was brought to bed,
and had a pretty girl, but they were so poor they
did not know how to get the babe christened, for they had
no money to pay the parson’s fees. So one day the father
went out to see if he could find any one who was willing
to stand for the
child and pay the
fees; but though
he walked about
the whole day from
one house to another,
and though
all said they were
willing enough to
stand, no one
thought himself
bound to pay the
fees. Now, when
he was going home
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_66" name="page_66"></a>66</span>
again, a lovely lady met him, dressed so fine, and she
looked so thoroughly good and kind; she offered to get
the babe christened, but after that, she said, she must keep
it for her own. The husband answered, he must first ask
his wife what she wished to do; but when he got home
and told his story, the wife said, right out, “No!”</p>
<p>Next day the man went out again, but no one would
stand if they had to pay the fees; and though he begged
and prayed, he could get no help. And again as he went
home, towards evening the same lovely lady met him,
who looked so sweet and good, and she made him the
same offer. So he told his wife again how he had fared,
and this time she said, if he couldn’t get any one to stand
for his babe next day, they must just let the lady have her
way, since she seemed so kind and good.</p>
<p>The third day, the man went about, but he couldn’t
get any one to stand; and so when, towards evening,
he met the kind lady again, he gave his word she should
have the babe if she would only get it christened at the
font. So next morning she came to the place where the
man lived, followed by two men to stand godfathers, took
the babe and carried it to church, and there it was
christened. After that she took it to her own house, and
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_67" name="page_67"></a>67</span>
there the little girl lived with her several years, and her
<i>Foster-mother</i> was always kind and friendly to her.</p>
<p>Now, when the <i>Lassie</i> had grown to be big enough to
know right and wrong, her <i>Foster-mother</i> got ready to go
on a journey.</p>
<p>“You have my leave,” she said, “to go all over the
house, except those rooms which I shew you;” and
when she had said that, away she went.</p>
<p>But the <i>Lassie</i> could not forbear just to open one of
the doors a little bit, when—<span class="smcap">Pop!</span> out flew a Star.</p>
<p>When her <i>Foster-mother</i> came back, she was very
vexed to find that the star had flown out, and she got
very angry with her <i>Foster-daughter</i>, and threatened to
send her away; but the child cried and begged so hard
that she got leave to stay.</p>
<p>Now, after a while, the <i>Foster-mother</i> had to go on
another journey; and, before she went, she forbade the
<i>Lassie</i> to go into those two rooms into which she had
never been. She promised to beware; but when she
was left alone, she began to think and to wonder what
there could be in the second room, and at last she could
not help setting the door a little ajar, just to peep in,
when—<span class="smcap">Pop!</span> out flew the Moon.</p>
<div class="figtag">

</div>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_68" name="page_68"></a>68</span></div>
<p>When her <i>Foster-mother</i> came home and found the
moon let out, she was very downcast, and said to the
<i>Lassie</i> she must go away, she could not stay with her
any longer. But the <i>Lassie</i> wept so bitterly, and prayed
so heartily for forgiveness, that this time, too, she got
leave to stay.</p>
<p>Some time after, the <i>Foster-mother</i> had to go away
again, and she charged the Lassie, who by this time was
half grown up, most earnestly that she mustn’t try to go
into, or to peep into, the third room. But when her
<i>Foster-mother</i> had been gone some time, and the <i>Lassie</i>
was weary of walking about alone, all at once she thought,
“Dear me, what fun it would be just to peep a little into
that third room.” Then she thought she mustn’t do it
for her <i>Foster-mother’s</i> sake; but when the bad thought
came the second time she could hold out no longer;
come what might, she must and would look into the
room; so she just opened the door a tiny bit, when—POP!
out flew the Sun.</p>
<div class="figtag">
<a name="linki_21" id="linki_21"></a>
</div>
<div class="figright" style="width:250px">
<img src="./eastofthesunwestofthemoon_files/gs09.png" alt="" title="" width="250" height="282"><br>
</div>
<p>But when her <i>Foster-mother</i> came back and saw that
the sun had flown away, she was cut to the heart, and
said, “Now, there was no help for it, the <i>Lassie</i> must
and should go away; she couldn’t hear of her staying
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_69" name="page_69"></a>69</span>
any longer.” Now
the <i>Lassie</i> cried
her eyes out, and
begged and prayed
so prettily; but it
was all no good.</p>
<p>“Nay! but I
must punish you!”
said her <i>Foster-mother</i>;
“but you
may have your
choice, either to
be the loveliest
woman in the
world, and not to be able to speak, or to keep your speech,
and to be the ugliest of all women; but away from me
you must go.”</p>
<p>And the <i>Lassie</i> said, “I would sooner be lovely.” So
she became all at once wondrous fair; but from that day
forth she was dumb.</p>
<p>So, when she went away from her <i>Foster-mother</i>, she
walked and wandered through a great, great wood; but
the farther she went, the farther off the end seemed to be.
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_70" name="page_70"></a>70</span>
So, when the evening came on, she clomb up into a tall
tree, which grew over a spring, and there she made herself
up to sleep that night. Close by lay a castle, and
from that castle came early every morning a maid to draw
water to make the Prince’s tea, from the spring over
which the <i>Lassie</i> was sitting. So the maid looked down
into the spring, saw the lovely face in the water, and
thought it was her own; then she flung away the pitcher,
and ran home; and, when she got there, she tossed
up her head and said, “If I’m so pretty, I’m far too good
to go and fetch water.”</p>
<p>So another maid had to go for the water, but the same
thing happened to her; she went back and said she was
far too pretty and too good to fetch water from the spring
for the Prince. Then the Prince went himself, for he
had a mind to see what all this could mean. So, when
he reached the spring, he too saw the image in the water;
but he looked up at once, and became aware of the
lovely <i>Lassie</i> who sate there up in the tree. Then he
coaxed her down and took her home; and at last made
up his mind to have her for his queen, because she
was so lovely; but his mother, who was still alive, was
against it.</p>

<p>“She can’t speak,” she said, “and maybe she’s a wicked
witch.”</p>
<p>But the Prince could not be content till he got her.
So after they had lived together a while, the <i>Lassie</i> was
to have a child, and when the child came to be born, the
Prince set a strong watch about her; but at the birth one
and all fell into a deep sleep, and her <i>Foster-mother</i> came,
cut the babe on its little finger, and smeared the queen’s
mouth with the blood; and said:</p>
<p>“Now you shall be as grieved as I was when you let
out the star;” and with these words she carried off the
babe.</p>
<p>But when those who were on the watch woke, they
thought the queen had eaten her own child, and the old
queen was all for burning her alive, but the Prince was
so fond of her that at last he begged her off, but he had
hard work to set her free.</p>
<p>So the next time the young queen was to have a child,
twice as strong a watch was set as the first time, but the
same thing happened over again, only this time her <i>Foster-mother</i>
said:</p>
<p>“Now you shall be as grieved as I was when you let
the moon out.”</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_72" name="page_72"></a>72</span></div>
<p>And the queen begged and prayed, and wept; for
when her <i>Foster-mother</i> was there, she could speak—but
it was all no good.</p>
<p>And now the old queen said she must be burnt, but
the Prince found means to beg her off. But when the
third child was to be born, a watch was set three times as
strong as the first, but just the same thing happened.
Her <i>Foster-mother</i> came while the watch slept, took the
babe, and cut its little finger, and smeared the queen’s
mouth with the blood, telling her now she should be
as grieved as she had been when the <i>Lassie</i> let out the
sun.</p>
<p>And now the Prince could not save her any longer.
She must and should be burnt. But just as they were
leading her to the stake, all at once they saw her <i>Foster-mother</i>,
who came with all three children—two she led by
the hand, and the third she had on her arm; and so she
went up to the young queen and said:</p>

again. I am the Virgin Mary, and so grieved as you
have been, so grieved was I when you let out sun, and
moon, and star. Now you have been punished for what
you did, and henceforth you shall have your speech.”</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_73" name="page_73"></a>73</span></div>
<p>How glad the Queen and Prince now were, all may
easily think, but no one can tell. After that they were
always happy; and from that day even the Prince’s mother
was very fond of the young queen.</p>

<h2>THE HUSBAND WHO WAS TO MIND THE HOUSE</h2>
</div>
<p><img class="dcap" src="./eastofthesunwestofthemoon_files/drop_o.png" alt="O" title="" width="75" height="73"><span class="smcap"><span class="dcap">O</span>nce</span> on a time there was a man, so surly and
cross, he never thought his <i>Wife</i> did anything
right in the house. So, one evening, in haymaking
time, he came home, scolding and swearing, and
showing his teeth and making a dust.</p>
<p>“Dear love, don’t be so angry; there’s a good man,”
said his goody; “to-morrow let’s change our work. I’ll
go out with the mowers and mow, and you shall mind the
house at home.”</p>
<p>Yes! the <i>Husband</i> thought that would do very well.
He was quite willing, he said.</p>
<p>So, early next morning, his goody took a scythe over
her neck, and went out into the hayfield with the mowers,
and began to mow; but the man was to mind the house,
and do the work at home.</p>
<p>First of all, he wanted to churn the butter; but when
he had churned a while, he got thirsty, and went down to
the cellar to tap a barrel of ale. So, just when he had
knocked in the bung, and was putting the tap into the
cask, he heard overhead the pig come into the kitchen.
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_76" name="page_76"></a>76</span>
Then off he ran up the cellar steps, with the tap in his
hand, as fast as he could, to look after the pig, lest it
should upset the churn; but when he got up, and saw
the pig had already knocked the churn over, and stood
there, routing and grunting amongst the cream which was
running all over the floor, he got so wild with rage that
he quite forgot the ale-barrel, and ran at the pig as hard
as he could. He caught it, too, just as it ran out of doors,
and gave it such a kick, that piggy lay for dead on the
spot. Then all at once he remembered he had the tap
in his hand; but when he got down to the cellar, every
drop of ale had run out of the cask.</p>
<p>Then he went into the dairy and found enough cream
left to fill the churn again, and so he began to churn, for
butter they must have at dinner. When he had churned
a bit, he remembered that their milking cow was still shut
up in the byre, and hadn’t had a bit to eat or a drop to
drink all the morning, though the sun was high. Then
all at once he thought ’twas too far to take her down to
the meadow, so he’d just get her up on the house top—for
the house, you must know, was thatched with sods,
and a fine crop of grass was growing there. Now the
house lay close up against a steep down, and he thought
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_77" name="page_77"></a>77</span>
if he laid a plank across to the thatch at the back he’d
easily get the cow up.</p>
<div class="figtag">
<a name="linki_25" id="linki_25"></a>
</div>
<div class="figright" style="width:250px">
<img src="./eastofthesunwestofthemoon_files/gs10.png" alt="" title="" width="250" height="275"><br>
</div>
<p>But still he couldn’t leave the churn, for there was his
little babe crawling about on the floor, and “if I leave
it,” he thought, “the child is safe to upset it.” So he took
the churn on his back, and went out with it; but then he
thought he’d better first water the cow before he turned
her out on the thatch; so he took up a bucket to draw
water out of the well; but, as he stooped down at the
well’s brink, all the cream ran out of the churn over his
shoulders, and so down into the well.</p>
<p>Now it was near dinner-time, and he hadn’t even got
the butter yet; so he thought he’d best boil the porridge,
and filled the pot with water and hung it over the fire.
When he had done that, he thought the cow might perhaps
fall off the thatch and break her legs or her neck. So he
got up on the house to tie her up. One end of the rope
he made fast to the cow’s neck and the other he slipped
down the chimney and tied round his own thigh; and he
had to make haste, for the water now began to boil in the
pot, and he had still to grind the oatmeal.</p>
<p>So he began to grind away; but while he was hard at
it, down fell the cow off the house-top after all, and as
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_78" name="page_78"></a>78</span>
she fell, she dragged the man up the chimney by the rope.
There he stuck fast; and as for the cow, she hung half-way
down the wall, swinging between heaven and earth,
for she could neither get down nor up.</p>
<p>And now the goody had waited seven lengths and
seven breadths for her <i>Husband</i> to come and call them
home to dinner; but never a call they had. At last she
thought she’d waited long enough, and went home. But
when she got there and saw the cow hanging in such an ugly
place, she ran up
and cut the rope
in two with her
scythe. But, as
she did this, down
came her <i>Husband</i>
out of the chimney;
and so, when
his old dame came
inside the kitchen,
there she found
him standing on
his head in the
porridge pot.</p>

one son; and as she was poorly and weak, her
son had to go up into the safe to fetch meal
for cooking; but when he got outside the safe, and was
just going down the steps, there came the <i>North Wind</i>
puffing and blowing, caught up the meal, and so away
with it through
the air. Then the
<i>Lad</i> went back
into the safe for
more; but when
he came out again
on the steps, if
the <i>North Wind</i>
didn’t come again
and carry off the
meal with a puff:
and, more than
that, he did so the
third time. At this
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_80" name="page_80"></a>80</span>
the <i>Lad</i> got very angry; and as he thought it hard that
the <i>North Wind</i> should behave so, he thought he’d just
look him up, and ask him to give up his meal.</p>
<p>So off he went, but the way was long, and he walked
and walked; but at last he came to the <i>North Wind’s</i>
house.</p>
<p>“Good day!” said the <i>Lad</i>, “and thank you for coming
to see us yesterday.”</p>
<p>“<span class="smcap">Good Day</span>!” answered the <i>North Wind</i>, for his
voice was loud and gruff, “<span class="smcap">and thanks for coming to see
me. What do you Want</span>?”</p>
<p>“Oh!” answered the <i>Lad</i>, “I only wished to ask you
to be so good as to let me have back that meal you took
from me on the safe steps, for we haven’t much to live on;
and if you’re to go on snapping up the morsel we have,
there’ll be nothing for it but to starve.”</p>
<p>“I haven’t got your meal,” said the <i>North Wind</i>; “but
if you are in such need, I’ll give you a cloth which will
get you everything you want, if you only say, ‘Cloth,
spread yourself, and serve up all kinds of good dishes!’”</p>
<p>With this the <i>Lad</i> was well content. But, as the
way was so long he couldn’t get home in one day, so he
turned into an inn on the way; and when they were going
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_81" name="page_81"></a>81</span>
to sit down to supper he laid the cloth on a table which
stood in the corner, and said:</p>
<p>“Cloth, spread yourself, and serve up all kinds of good
dishes.”</p>
<p>He had scarce said so before the cloth did as it was bid;
and all who stood by thought it a fine thing, but most of
all the landlady. So, when all were fast asleep at dead of
night, she took the <i>Lad’s</i> cloth, and put another in its
stead, just like the one he had got from the <i>North Wind</i>,
but which couldn’t so much as serve up a bit of dry bread.</p>
<p>So, when the <i>Lad</i> woke, he took his cloth and went
off with it, and that day he got home to his mother.</p>
<p>“Now,” said he, “I’ve been to the <i>North Wind’s</i>
house, and a good fellow he is, for he gave me this cloth,
and when I only say to it, ‘Cloth, spread yourself, and
serve up all kinds of good dishes,’ I get any sort of food
I please.”</p>
<p>“All very true, I daresay,” said his mother; “but
seeing is believing, and I shan’t believe it till I see it.”</p>
<p>So the <i>Lad</i> made haste, drew out a table, laid the
cloth on it, and said:</p>
<p>“Cloth, spread yourself, and serve up all kinds of
good dishes.”</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_82" name="page_82"></a>82</span></div>
<p>But never a bit of dry bread did the cloth serve up.</p>
<p>“Well,” said the <i>Lad</i> “there’s no help for it but to
go to the <i>North Wind</i> again;” and away he went.</p>
<p>So he came to where the <i>North Wind</i> lived late in
the afternoon.</p>
<p>“Good evening!” said the <i>Lad</i>.</p>
<p>“Good evening!” said the <i>North Wind</i>.</p>
<p>“I want my rights for that meal of ours which you
took,” said the <i>Lad</i>; “for, as for that cloth I got, it isn’t
worth a penny.”</p>
<p>“I’ve got no meal,” said the <i>North Wind</i>; “but
yonder you have a ram which coins nothing but golden
ducats as soon as you say to it: ‘Ram, ram! make
money!’”</p>
<p>So the <i>Lad</i> thought this a fine thing; but as it was
too far to get home that day, he turned in for the night
to the same inn where he had slept before.</p>
<p>Before he called for anything, he tried the truth of
what the <i>North Wind</i> had said of the ram, and found it
all right; but, when the landlord saw that, he thought it
was a famous ram, and, when the <i>Lad</i> had fallen asleep,
he took another which couldn’t coin gold ducats, and
changed the two.</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_83" name="page_83"></a>83</span></div>
<p>Next morning off went the <i>Lad</i>; and when he got
home to his mother, he said:</p>
<p>“After all, the <i>North Wind</i> is a jolly fellow; for now
he has given me a ram which can coin golden ducats if I
only say: ‘Ram, ram! make money!’”</p>
<p>“All very true, I daresay,” said his mother; “but I
shan’t believe any such stuff until I see the ducats made.”</p>
<p>“Ram, ram! make money!” said the <i>Lad</i>; but if the
ram made anything, it wasn’t money.</p>
<p>So the <i>Lad</i> went back again to the <i>North Wind</i>, and
blew him up, and said the ram was worth nothing, and
he must have his rights for the meal.</p>
<p>“Well!” said the <i>North Wind</i>; “I’ve nothing else to
give you but that old stick in the corner yonder; but its
a stick of that kind that if you say: ‘Stick, stick! lay on!’
it lays on till you say: ‘Stick, stick! now stop!’”</p>
<p>So, as the way was long, the <i>Lad</i> turned in this night
too to the landlord; but as he could pretty well guess how
things stood as to the cloth and the ram, he lay down at
once on the bench and began to snore, as if he were asleep.</p>
<p>Now the landlord, who easily saw that the stick must
be worth something, hunted up one which was like it, and
when he heard the lad snore, was going to change the
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_84" name="page_84"></a>84</span>
two; but, just as the landlord was about to take it, the
<i>Lad</i> bawled out:</p>
<p>“Stick, stick! lay on!”</p>
<p>So the stick began to beat the landlord, till he jumped
over chairs, and tables, and benches, and yelled and roared:</p>
<p>“Oh my! oh my! bid the stick be still, else it will
beat me to death, and you shall have back both your cloth
and your ram.”</p>
<p>When the <i>Lad</i> thought the landlord had got enough,
he said:</p>
<p>“Stick, stick! now stop!”</p>
<p>Then he took the cloth and put it into his pocket,
and went home with his stick in his hand, leading the ram
by a cord round its horns; and so he got his rights for
the meal he had lost.</p>

close by a palace, and fished for the <i>King’s</i>
table. One day when he was out fishing he
just caught nothing. Do what he would—however he
tried with bait and angle—there was never a sprat on his
hook. But when the day was far spent a head bobbed
up out of the
water, and said:</p>
<p>“If I may
have what your
wife bears under
her girdle, you
shall catch fish
enough.”</p>
<p>So the man
answered boldly,
“Yes;” for he did
not know that his
wife was going to
have a child. After
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_86" name="page_86"></a>86</span>
that, as was like enough, he caught plenty of fish of all
kinds. But when he got home at night and told his
story, how he had got all that fish, his wife fell a-weeping
and moaning, and was beside herself for the promise
which her husband had made, for she said, “I bear a babe
under my girdle.”</p>
<p>Well, the story soon spread, and came up to the
castle; and when the <i>King</i> heard the woman’s grief and
its cause, he sent down to say he would take care of the
child, and see if he couldn’t save it.</p>
<p>So the months went on and on, and when her time
came the fisher’s wife had a boy; so the king took it at
once, and brought it up as his own son, until the lad
grew up. Then he begged leave one day to go out
fishing with his father; he had such a mind to go, he
said. At first the <i>King</i> wouldn’t hear of it, but at last
the lad had his way, and went. So he and his father
were out the whole day, and all went right and well till
they landed at night. Then the lad remembered he had
left his handkerchief, and went to look for it; but as
soon as ever he got into the boat, it began to move off
with him at such speed that the water roared under the
bow, and all the lad could do in rowing against it with
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_87" name="page_87"></a>87</span>
the oars was no use; so he went and went the whole
night, and at last he came to a white strand, far far away.</p>
<p>There he went ashore, and when he had walked about
a bit, an old, old man met him, with a long white beard.</p>
<p>“What’s the name of this land?” asked the lad.</p>
<p>“Whiteland,” said the man, who went on to ask the
lad whence he came, and what he was going to do. So
the lad told him all.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>“Aye, aye!” said the man; “now when you have
walked a little farther along the strand here, you’ll come
to three <i>Princesses</i>, whom you will see standing in the
earth up to their necks, with only their heads out. Then
the first—she is the eldest—will call out and beg you so
prettily to come and help her; and the second will do
the same; to neither of these shall you go; make haste
past them, as if you neither saw nor heard anything.
But the third you shall go to, and do what she asks.
If you do this, you’ll have good luck—that’s all.”</p>
<p>When the lad came to the first <i>Princess</i>, she called
out to him, and begged him so prettily to come to her,
but he passed on as though he saw her not. In the same
way he passed by the second; but to the third he went
straight up.</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_88" name="page_88"></a>88</span></div>
<p>“If you’ll do what I bid you,” she said, “you may
have which of us you please.”</p>
<p>“Yes;” he was willing enough; so she told him how
three <i>Trolls</i> had set them down in the earth there; but
before they had lived in the castle up among the trees.</p>
<p>“Now,” she said, “you must go into that castle, and
let the <i>Trolls</i> whip you each one night for each of us.
If you can bear that, you’ll set us free.”</p>
<p>Well, the lad said he was ready to try.</p>
<p>“When you go in,” the <i>Princess</i> went on to say,
“you’ll see two lions standing at the gate; but if you’ll
only go right in the middle between them they’ll do you
no harm. Then go straight on into a little dark room,
and make your bed. Then the <i>Troll</i> will come to whip
you; but if you take the flask which hangs on the wall,
and rub yourself with the ointment that’s in it, wherever
his lash falls, you’ll be as sound as ever. Then grasp the
sword that hangs by the side of the flask and strike the
<i>Troll</i> dead.”</p>
<p>Yes, he did as the <i>Princess</i> told him; he passed in the
midst between the lions, as if he hadn’t seen them, and
went straight into the little room, and there he lay down
to sleep. The first night there came a <i>Troll</i> with three
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_89" name="page_89"></a>89</span>
heads and three rods, and whipped the lad soundly; but
he stood it till the <i>Troll</i> was done; then he took the
flask and rubbed himself, and grasped the sword and slew
the <i>Troll</i>.</p>
<p>So, when he went out next morning, the <i>Princesses</i>
stood out of the earth up to their waists.</p>
<p>The next night ’twas the same story over again, only
this time the <i>Troll</i> had six heads and six rods, and he
whipped him far worse than the first; but when he went
out next morning,
the <i>Princesses</i>
stood out of the
earth as far as the
knee.</p>
<div class="figtag">

</div>
<p>The third
night there came a
<i>Troll</i> that had nine
heads and nine
rods, and he
whipped and
flogged the lad so
long that he fainted
away; then the
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_90" name="page_90"></a>90</span>
<i>Troll</i> took him up and dashed him against the wall; but
the shock brought down the flask, which fell on the lad,
burst, and spilled the ointment all over him, and so he
became as strong and sound as ever again. Then he wasn’t
slow; he grasped the sword and slew the <i>Troll</i>; and next
morning when he went out of the castle the <i>Princesses</i>
stood before him with all their bodies out of the earth.
So he took the youngest for his <i>Queen</i>, and lived well
and happily with her for some time.</p>
<p>At last he began to long to go home for a little to see
his parents. His <i>Queen</i> did not like this; but at last his
heart was so set on it, and he longed and longed so much,
there was no holding him back, so she said:</p>
<p>“One thing you must promise me. This—only to
do what your father begs you to do, and not what mother
wishes;” and that he promised.</p>
<p>Then she gave him a ring, which was of that kind
that any one who wore it might wish two wishes. So
he wished himself home, and when he got home his
parents could not wonder enough what a grand man their
son had become.</p>
<p>Now, when he had been at home some days, his
mother wished him to go up to the palace and show the
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_91" name="page_91"></a>91</span>
<i>King</i> what a fine fellow he had come to be. But his
father said:</p>
<p>“No! don’t let him do that; if he does, we shan’t
have any more joy of him this time.”</p>
<p>But it was no good, the mother begged and prayed so
long that at last he went. So when he got up to the
palace he was far braver, both in clothes and array, than
the other king, who didn’t quite like this, and at last he
said:</p>
<p>“All very fine; but here you can see my <i>Queen</i>, what
like she is, but I can’t see yours: that I can’t. Do you
know, I scarce think she’s so good-looking as mine.”</p>
<p>“Would to Heaven,” said the young <i>King</i>, “she were
standing here, then you’d see what she was like.” And
that instant there she stood before them.</p>
<p>But she was very woeful, and said to him:</p>
<p>“Why did you not mind what I told you; and why
did you not listen to what your father said? Now, I must
away home, and as for you, you have had both your wishes.”</p>
<p>With that she knitted a ring among his hair with her
name on it, and wished herself home, and was off.</p>
<p>Then the young <i>King</i> was cut to the heart, and went,
day out day in, thinking and thinking how he should get
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_92" name="page_92"></a>92</span>
back to his <i>Queen</i>. “I’ll just try,” he thought, “if I can’t
learn where Whiteland lies;” and so he went out into the
world to ask. So when he had gone a good way, he came
to a high hill, and there he met one who was lord over
all the beasts of the wood, for they all came home to him
when he blew his horn; so the <i>King</i> asked if he knew
where Whiteland was.</p>
<p>“No, I don’t,” said he, “but I’ll ask my beasts.” Then
he blew his horn and called them, and asked if any of
them knew where Whiteland lay. But there was no beast
that knew.</p>
<p>So the man gave him a pair of snow-shoes.</p>

<i>So the man gave him a pair of snow-shoes.</i><br>
</p>
</div>
<p>“When you get on these,” he said, “you’ll come to
my brother, who lives hundreds of miles off; he is lord
over all the birds of the air. Ask him. When you reach
his house, just turn the shoes so that the toes point this
way, and they’ll come home of themselves.” So when the
<i>King</i> reached the house, he turned the shoes as the lord
of the beasts had said, and away they went home of
themselves.</p>
<p>So he asked again after Whiteland, and the man called
all the birds with a blast of his horn, and asked if any of
them knew where Whiteland lay; but none of the birds
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_93" name="page_93"></a>93</span>
knew. Now, long, long after the rest of the birds came
an old eagle, which had been away ten round years, but
he couldn’t tell any more than the rest.</p>
<p>“Well, well,” said the man, “I’ll lend you a pair of
snow-shoes, and, when you get them on, they’ll carry you
to my brother, who lives hundreds of miles off; he’s lord
of all the fish in the sea; you’d better ask him. But don’t
forget to turn the toes of the shoes this way.”</p>
<p>The <i>King</i> was full of thanks, got on the shoes, and
when he came to the man who was lord over the fish of
the sea, he turned the toes round, and so off they went
home like the other pair. After that, he asked again
after Whiteland.</p>
<p>So the man called the fish with a blast, but no fish
could tell where it lay. At last came an old pike, which
they had great work to call home, he was such a way off.
So when they asked him he said:</p>
<p>“Know it? I should think I did! I’ve been cook there
ten years, and to-morrow I’m going there again; for now
the queen of Whiteland, whose king is away, is going to
wed another husband.”</p>
<p>“Well!” said the man, “as this is so, I’ll give you a
bit of advice. Hereabouts, on a moor, stand three brothers,
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_94" name="page_94"></a>94</span>
and here they have stood these hundred years, fighting
about a hat, a cloak, and a pair of boots. If any one has
these three things he can make himself invisible, and wish
himself anywhere he pleases. You can tell them you wish
to try the things, and, after that, you’ll pass judgment
between them, whose they shall be.”</p>
<p>Yes! the <i>King</i> thanked the man, and went and did as
he told him.</p>
<p>“What’s all this?” he said to the brothers. “Why do
you stand here fighting for ever and a day? Just let me
try these things, and I’ll give judgment whose they shall be.”</p>
<p>They were very willing to do this; but, as soon as he
had got the hat, cloak, and boots, he said:</p>
<p>“When we meet next time, I’ll tell you my judgment,”
and with these words he wished himself away.</p>
<p>So as he went along up in the air, he came up with
the North wind.</p>
<p>“Whither away?” roared the North Wind.</p>
<p>“To Whiteland,” said the <i>King</i>; <a name="TC_6"></a><ins class="trchange" title="Removed extra double-quote">and</ins> then he told
him all that had befallen him.</p>
<p>“Ah,” said the North Wind, “you go faster than I—you
do; for you can go straight, while I have to puff and
blow round every turn and corner. But when you get
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_95" name="page_95"></a>95</span>
there, just place yourself on the stairs by the side of the
door, and then I’ll come storming in, as though I were
going to blow down the whole castle. And then when
the prince, who is to have your <i>Queen</i>, comes out to see
what’s the matter, just you take him by the collar and
pitch him out of doors; then I’ll look after him, and see
if I can’t carry him off.”</p>

<p>Well, the <i>King</i> did as the North Wind said. He took
his stand on the stairs, and when the North Wind came,
storming and roaring, and took hold of the castle wall, so
that it shook again, the prince came out to see what was
the matter. But as soon as ever he came, the <i>King</i>
caught him by the collar and pitched him out of doors,
and then the North Wind caught him up and carried him
off. So when there was an end of him, the <i>King</i> went
into the castle, and at first his <i>Queen</i> didn’t know him,
he was so wan and thin, through wandering so far and
being so woeful; but when he shewed her the ring, she
was as glad as glad could be; and so the rightful wedding
was held, and the fame of it spread far and wide.</p>

<h2>SORIA MORIA CASTLE</h2>
</div>
<p><img class="dcap" src="./eastofthesunwestofthemoon_files/drop_o.png" alt="O" title="" width="75" height="73"><span class="smcap"><span class="dcap">O</span>nce</span> on a time there was a poor couple who had
a son whose name was <i>Halvor</i>. Ever since he
was a little boy he would turn his hand to
nothing, but just sat there and groped about in the ashes.
His father and mother often put him out to learn this
trade or that, but <i>Halvor</i> could stay nowhere; for, when
he had been there a day or two, he ran away from his
master, and never stopped till he was sitting again in the
ingle, poking about in the cinders.</p>
<p>Well, one day a skipper came, and asked <i>Halvor</i> if
he hadn’t a mind to be with him, and go to sea, and see
strange lands. Yes, <i>Halvor</i> would like that very much;
so he wasn’t long in getting himself ready.</p>
<p>How long they sailed I’m sure I can’t tell; but the
end of it was, they fell into a great storm, and when it
was blown over, and it got still again, they couldn’t tell
where they were; for they had been driven away to a
strange coast, which none of them knew anything about.</p>
<p>Well, as there was just no wind at all, they stayed
lying wind-bound there, and <i>Halvor</i> asked the skipper’s
leave to go on shore and look about him; he would
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_98" name="page_98"></a>98</span>
sooner go, he said, than lie there and sleep.</p>
<p>“Do you think now you’re fit to show yourself before
folk,” said the skipper, “why, you’ve no clothes but
those rags you stand in?”</p>
<p>But <i>Halvor</i> stuck to his own, and so at last he got
leave, but he was to be sure and come back as soon as
ever it began to blow. So off he went and found a lovely
land; wherever he came there were fine large flat cornfields
and rich meads, but he couldn’t catch a glimpse of
a living soul. Well, it began to blow, but <i>Halvor</i>
thought he hadn’t seen enough yet, and he wanted to
walk a little farther just to see if he couldn’t meet any
folk. So after a while he came to a broad high road, so
smooth and even, you might easily roll an egg along it.
<i>Halvor</i> followed this, and when evening drew on he saw
a great castle ever so far off, from which the sunbeams
shone. So as he had now walked the whole day and
hadn’t taken a bit to eat with him, he was as hungry as
a hunter, but still the nearer he came to the castle, the
more afraid he got.</p>
<p>In the castle kitchen a great fire was blazing, and
<i>Halvor</i> went into it, but such a kitchen he had never seen
in all his born days. It was so grand and fine; there
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_99" name="page_99"></a>99</span>
were vessels of silver and vessels of gold, but still never a
living soul. So when <i>Halvor</i> had stood there a while and
no one came out, he went and opened a door, and there
inside sat a <i>Princess</i> who span upon a spinning-wheel.</p>
<p>“Nay, nay, now!” she called out, “dare Christian
folk come hither? But now you’d best be off about your
business, if you don’t want the <i>Troll</i> to gobble you up;
for here lives a <i>Troll</i> with three heads.”</p>
<p>“All one to me,” said the lad, “I’d be just as glad to
hear he had four heads beside; I’d like to see what kind
of fellow he is. As for going, I won’t go at all. I’ve
done no harm; but meat you must get me, for I’m almost
starved to death.”</p>
<p>When <i>Halvor</i> had eaten his fill, the <i>Princess</i> told him
to try if he could brandish the sword that hung against the
wall; no, he couldn’t brandish it, he couldn’t even lift it up.</p>
<p>“Oh!” said the <i>Princess</i>, “now you must go and take
a pull of that flask that hangs by its side; that’s what the
<i>Troll</i> does every time he goes out to use the sword.”</p>
<p>So <i>Halvor</i> took a pull, and in the twinkling of an eye he
could brandish the sword like nothing; and now he thought
it high time the <i>Troll</i> came; and lo! just then up came the
<i>Troll</i> puffing and blowing. <i>Halvor</i> jumped behind the door.</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_100" name="page_100"></a>100</span></div>
<p>“<span class="smcap">Hutetu</span>,” said the <i>Troll</i>, as he put his head in at
the door, “what a smell of Christian man’s blood!”</p>
<p>“Aye,” said <i>Halvor</i>, “you’ll soon know that to your
cost,” and with that he hewed off all his heads.</p>
<p>Now the <i>Princess</i> was so glad that she was free, she
both danced and sang, but then all at once she called her
sisters to mind, and so she said:</p>
<p>“Would my sisters were free too!”</p>
<p>“Where are they?” asked <i>Halvor</i>.</p>
<p>Well, she told him all about it; one was taken away by
a <i>Troll</i> to his Castle which lay fifty miles off, and the other by
another <i>Troll</i> to his Castle which was fifty miles further still.</p>
<p>“But now,” she said, “you must first help me to get
this ugly carcass out of the house.”</p>
<p>Yes, <i>Halvor</i> was so strong he swept everything away,
and made it all clean and tidy in no time. So they had
a good and happy time of it, and next morning he set off
at peep of grey dawn; he could take no rest by the way,
but ran and walked the whole day. When he first saw
the Castle he got a little afraid; it was far grander than
the first, but here too there wasn’t a living soul to be seen.
So <i>Halvor</i> went into the kitchen, and didn’t stop there
either, but went straight further on into the house.</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_101" name="page_101"></a>101</span></div>
<p>“Nay, nay,” called out the <i>Princess</i>, “dare Christian
folk come hither? I don’t know I’m sure how long it
is since I came here, but in all that time I haven’t seen a
Christian man. ’Twere best you saw how to get away as
fast as you came; for here lives a <i>Troll</i> who has six heads.”</p>
<p>“I shan’t go,” said <i>Halvor</i>, “if he has six heads besides.”</p>
<p>“He’ll take you up and swallow you down alive,”
said the <i>Princess</i>.</p>
<p>But it was no good, <i>Halvor</i> wouldn’t go; he wasn’t
at all afraid of the <i>Troll</i>, but meat and drink he must
have, for he was half starved after his long journey. Well,
he got as much of that as he wished, but then the <i>Princess</i>
wanted him to be off again.</p>
<p>“No,” said <i>Halvor</i>, “I won’t go, I’ve done no harm,
and I’ve nothing to be afraid about.”</p>
<p>“He won’t stay to ask that,” said the <i>Princess</i>, “for
he’ll take you without law or leave; but as you won’t go,
just try if you can brandish that sword yonder, which the
<i>Troll</i> wields in war.”</p>
<p>He couldn’t brandish it, and then the <i>Princess</i> said he
must take a pull at the flask which hung by its side, and
when he had done that he could brandish it.</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_102" name="page_102"></a>102</span></div>
<p>Just then back came the <i>Troll</i>, and he was both stout
and big, so that he had to go sideways to get through the
door. When the <i>Troll</i> got his first head in he called out:</p>
<p>“<span class="smcap">Hutetu</span>, what a smell of Christian man’s blood!”</p>
<p>But that very moment <i>Halvor</i> hewed off his first
head, and so on all the rest as they popped in. The
<i>Princess</i> was overjoyed, but just then she came to think of
her sisters, and wished out loud they were free. <i>Halvor</i>
thought that might easily be done, and wanted to be off
at once; but first he had to help the <i>Princess</i> to get the
<i>Troll’s</i> carcass out of the way, and so he could only set
out next morning.</p>
<p>It was a long way to the Castle, and he had to walk
fast and run hard to reach it in time; but about nightfall
he saw the Castle, which was far finer and grander
than either of the others. This time he wasn’t the least
afraid, but walked straight through the kitchen, and into
the Castle. There sat a <i>Princess</i> who was so pretty, there
was no end to her loveliness. She too like the others
told him there hadn’t been Christian folk there ever since
she came thither, and bade him go away again, else the
<i>Troll</i> would swallow him alive, and do you know, she
said, he has nine heads.</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_103" name="page_103"></a>103</span></div>
<p>“Aye, aye,” said <i>Halvor</i>, “if he had nine other heads,
and nine other heads still, I won’t go away,” and so he
stood fast before the stove. The <i>Princess</i> kept on begging
him so prettily to go away, lest the <i>Troll</i> should
gobble him up, but <i>Halvor</i> said:</p>
<p>“Let him come as soon as he likes.”</p>
<p>So she gave him the <i>Troll’s</i> sword, and bade him
take a pull at the flask, that he might be able to brandish
and wield it.</p>
<p>Just then back came the <i>Troll</i> puffing and blowing
and tearing along. He was far bigger and stouter than
the other two, and he too had to go on one side to get
through the door. So when he got his first head in, he
said as the others had said:</p>
<p>“<span class="smcap">Hutetu</span>, what a smell of Christian man’s blood!”</p>
<p>That very moment <i>Halvor</i> hewed off the first head
and then all the rest; but the last was the toughest of them
all, and it was the hardest bit of work <i>Halvor</i> had to do, to
get it hewn off, although he knew very well he had strength
enough to do it.</p>
<p>So all the <i>Princesses</i> came together to that Castle,
which was called <i>Soria Moria Castle</i>, and they were glad
and happy as they had never been in all their lives before,
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_104" name="page_104"></a>104</span>
and they all were
fond of <i>Halvor</i>
and <i>Halvor</i> of
them, and he
might choose the
one he liked best
for his bride; but
the youngest was
fondest of him of
all the three.</p>
<div class="figtag">
<a name="linki_34" id="linki_34"></a>
</div>
<div class="figright" style="width:250px">
<img src="./eastofthesunwestofthemoon_files/gs15.png" alt="" title="" width="250" height="279"><br>
</div>
<p>But there
after a while, <i>Halvor</i>
went about,
and was so strange
and dull and silent. Then the Princesses asked him what
he lacked, and if he didn’t like to live with them any
longer? Yes, he did, for they had enough and to spare,
and he was well off in every way, but still somehow or
other he did so long to go home, for his father and
mother were alive, and them he had such a great wish to
see.</p>
<p>Well, they thought that might be done easily
enough.</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_105" name="page_105"></a>105</span></div>
<p>“You shall go thither and come back hither, safe and
unscathed, if you will only follow our advice,” said the
<i>Princesses</i>.</p>
<p>Yes, he’d be sure to mind all they said. So they
dressed him up till he was as grand as a king’s son, and
then they set a ring on his finger, and that was such a
ring, he could wish himself thither and hither with it; but
they told him to be sure and not take it off, and not to
name their names, for there would be an end of all his
bravery, and then he’d never see them more.</p>
<p>“If I only stood at home I’d be glad,” said <i>Halvor</i>;
and it was done as he had wished. Then stood <i>Halvor</i>
at his father’s cottage door before he knew a word about
it. Now it was about dusk at even, and so, when they
saw such a grand stately lord walk in, the old couple got
so afraid they began to bow and scrape. Then <i>Halvor</i>
asked if he couldn’t stay there, and have a lodging there
that night. No; that he couldn’t.</p>
<p>“We can’t do it at all,” they said, “for we haven’t
this thing or that thing which such a lord is used to have;
’twere best your lordship went up to the farm, no long
way off, for you can see the chimneys, and there they
have lots of everything.”</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_106" name="page_106"></a>106</span></div>
<p><i>Halvor</i> wouldn’t hear of it—he wanted to stop; but
the old couple stuck to their own, that he had better go
to the farmer’s; there he would get both meat and drink;
as for them, they hadn’t even a chair to offer him to sit
down on.</p>
<p>“No,” said <i>Halvor</i>, “I won’t go up there till to-morrow
early, but let me just stay here to-night; worst
come to the worst, I can sit in the chimney corner.”</p>
<p>Well, they couldn’t say anything against that; so
<i>Halvor</i> sat down by the ingle, and began to poke about
in the ashes, just as he used to do when he lay at home
in old days, and stretched his lazy bones.</p>
<p>Well, they chattered and talked about many things;
and they told <i>Halvor</i> about this thing and that; and so
he asked them if they had never had any children.</p>
<p>Yes, yes, they had once a lad whose name was
<i>Halvor</i>, but they didn’t know whither he had wandered;
they couldn’t even tell whether he were dead or alive.</p>
<p>“Couldn’t it be me, now?” said <i>Halvor</i>.</p>
<p>“Let me see; I could tell him well enough,” said the
old wife, and rose up. “Our <i>Halvor</i> was so lazy and
dull, he never did a thing; and besides, he was so ragged,
that one tatter took hold of the next tatter on him. No;
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_107" name="page_107"></a>107</span>
there never was the making of such a fine fellow in him
as you are, master.”</p>
<p>A little while after the old wife went to the hearth to
poke up the fire, and when the blaze fell on <i>Halvor’s</i> face,
just as when he was at home of old poking about in the
ashes, she knew him at once.</p>
<p>“Ah! but it is you after all, <i>Halvor</i>?” she cried;
and then there was such joy for the old couple, there was
no end to it; and he was forced to tell how he had fared,
and the old dame was so fond and proud of him, nothing
would do but he must go up at once to the farmer’s, and
show himself to the lassies, who had always looked down
on him. And off she went first, and <i>Halvor</i> followed
after. So, when she got up there, she told them all how
<i>Halvor</i> had come home again, and now they should only
just see how grand he was, for, said she, “he looks like
nothing but a King’s son.”</p>
<p>“All very fine,” said the lassies, and tossed up their
heads. “We’ll be bound he’s just the same beggarly
ragged boy he always was.”</p>
<p>Just then in walked <i>Halvor</i>, and then the lassies were
all so taken aback, they forgot their sarks in the ingle,
where they were sitting darning their clothes, and ran out
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_108" name="page_108"></a>108</span>
in their smocks. Well, when they were got back again,
they were so shamefaced they scarce dared look at <i>Halvor</i>,
towards whom they had always been proud and haughty.</p>
<p>“Aye, aye,” said <i>Halvor</i>, “you always thought yourselves
so pretty and neat, no one could come near you;
but now you should just see the eldest <i>Princess</i> I have set
free; against her you look just like milkmaids, and the
midmost is prettier still; but the youngest, who is my
sweetheart, she’s fairer than both sun and moon. Would
to Heaven they were only here,” said <i>Halvor</i>, “then you’d
see what you would see.”</p>
<p>He had scarce uttered these words before there they
stood, but then he felt so sorry, for now what they had
said came into his mind. Up at the farm there was a
great feast got ready for the <i>Princesses</i>, and much was
made of them, but they wouldn’t stop there.</p>
<p>“No, we want to go down to your father and mother,”
they said to <i>Halvor</i>; “and so we’ll go out now and look
about us.”</p>
<p>So he went down with them, and they came to a great
lake just outside the farm. Close by the water was such
a lovely green bank; here the <i>Princesses</i> said they would
sit and rest a while; they thought it so sweet to sit down
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_109" name="page_109"></a>109</span>
and look over the
water.</p>
<div class="figtag">
<a name="linki_35" id="linki_35"></a>
</div>
<div class="figright" style="width:250px">
<img src="./eastofthesunwestofthemoon_files/gs16.png" alt="" title="" width="250" height="277"><br>
</div>
<p>So they sat
down there, and
when they had sat
a while the youngest
<i>Princess</i> said:</p>
<p>“I may as
well comb your
hair a little, <i>Halvor</i>.”</p>
<p>Well, <i>Halvor</i>
laid his head on
her lap, and she
combed his bonny locks, and it wasn’t long before <i>Halvor</i>
fell fast asleep. Then she took the ring from his finger,
and put another in its stead; and she said:</p>
<p>“Now hold me all together! and now would we were
all in <i>Soria Moria Castle</i>.”</p>
<p>So when <i>Halvor</i> woke up, he could very well tell
that he had lost the <i>Princesses</i>, and began to weep and
wail; and he was so downcast, they couldn’t comfort him
at all. In spite of all his father and mother said, he
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_110" name="page_110"></a>110</span>
wouldn’t stop there, but took farewell of them, and said
he was safe not to see them again; for if he couldn’t find
the <i>Princesses</i> again, he thought it not worth while to live.</p>
<p>Well, he had still about sixty pounds left, so he put
them into his pocket, and set out on his way. So, when
he had walked a while, he met a man with a tidy horse,
and he wanted to buy it, and began to chaffer with the
man.</p>
<p>“Aye,” said the man, “to tell the truth, I never
thought of selling him; but if we could strike a bargain
perhaps—”</p>
<p>“What do you want for him?” asked <i>Halvor</i>.</p>
<p>“I didn’t give much for him, nor is he worth much;
he’s a brave horse to ride, but he can’t draw at all; still
he’s strong enough to carry your knapsack and you too,
turn and turn about,” said the man.</p>
<p>At last they agreed on the price, and <i>Halvor</i> laid the
knapsack on him, and so he walked a bit, and rode a bit,
turn and turn about. At night he came to a green plain
where stood a great tree, at the roots of which he sat
down. There he let the horse loose, but he didn’t lie
down to sleep, but opened his knapsack and took a meal.
At peep of day off he set again, for he could take no
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_111" name="page_111"></a>111</span>
rest. So he rode and walked and walked and rode the
whole day through the wide wood, where there were
so many green spots and glades that shone so bright and
lovely between the trees. He didn’t know at all where
he was or whither he was going, but he gave himself no
more time to rest than when his horse cropped a bit of
grass, and he took a snack out of his knapsack when they
came to one of those green glades. So he went on walking
and riding by turns, and as for the wood there seemed to
be no end to it.</p>
<p>But at dusk the next day he saw a light gleaming
away through the trees.</p>
<p>“Would there were folk hereaway,” thought <i>Halvor</i>,
“that I might warm myself a bit and get a morsel to keep
body and soul together.”</p>
<p>When he got up to it he saw the light came from a
wretched little hut, and through the window he saw an
old old, couple inside. They were as grey-headed as a
pair of doves, and the old wife had such a nose! why, it
was so long she used it for a poker to stir the fire as she
sat in the ingle.</p>
<p>“Good evening,” said <i>Halvor</i>.</p>
<p>“Good evening,” said the old wife.</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_112" name="page_112"></a>112</span></div>
<p>“But what errand can you have in coming hither?”
she went on, “for no Christian folk have been here these
hundred years and more.”</p>
<p>Well, <i>Halvor</i> told her all about himself, and how he
wanted to get to <i>Soria Moria Castle</i>, and asked if she
knew the way thither.</p>
<p>“No,” said the old wife, “that I don’t, but see now,
here comes the Moon, I’ll ask her, she’ll know all about
it, for doesn’t she shine on everything?”</p>
<p>So when the Moon stood clear and bright over the
tree-tops, the old wife went out.</p>
<p>“<span class="smcap">Thou Moon, thou Moon</span>,” she screamed, “canst
thou tell me the way to <i>Soria Moria Castle</i>?”</p>
<p>“No,” said the Moon, “that I can’t, for the last time
I shone there a cloud stood before me.”</p>
<p>“Wait a bit still,” said the old wife to <i>Halvor</i>, “bye
and bye comes the West Wind; he’s sure to know it, for
he puffs and blows round every corner.”</p>
<p>“Nay, nay,” said the old wife when she went out
again, “you don’t mean to say you’ve got a horse too;
just turn the poor beastie loose in our ‘toun,’ and don’t
let him stand there and starve to death at the door.”</p>
<p>Then she ran on:</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_113" name="page_113"></a>113</span></div>
<p>“But won’t you swop him away to me?—we’ve got
an old pair of boots here, with which you can take twenty
miles at each stride; those you shall have for your horse,
and so you’ll get all the sooner to <i>Soria Moria Castle</i>.”</p>
<p>That <i>Halvor</i> was willing to do at once; and the old
wife was so glad at having the horse, she was ready to
dance and skip for joy.</p>
<p>“For now,” she said, “I shall be able to ride to
church. I, too, think of that.”</p>
<p>As for <i>Halvor</i>, he had no rest, and wanted to be off
at once, but the old wife said there was no hurry.</p>
<p>“Lie down on the bench with you and sleep a bit,
for we’ve no bed to offer you, and I’ll watch and wake
you when the West Wind comes.”</p>
<p>So after a while up came the West Wind, roaring and
howling along till the walls creaked and groaned again.</p>
<p>Out ran the old wife.</p>
<p>“<span class="smcap">Thou West Wind, thou West Wind!</span> Canst thou
tell me the way to <i>Soria Moria Castle</i>? Here’s one
who wants to get thither.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I know it very well,” said the West Wind, “and
now I’m just off thither to dry clothes for the wedding
that’s to be; if he’s swift of foot he can go along with me.”</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_114" name="page_114"></a>114</span></div>
<p>Out ran <i>Halvor</i>.</p>
<p>“You’ll have to stretch your legs if you mean to
keep up,” said the West Wind.</p>
<p>So off he set over field and hedge, and hill and fell,
and <i>Halvor</i> had hard work to keep up.</p>
<p>“Well,” said the West Wind, “now I’ve no time to
stay with you any longer, for I’ve got to go away yonder
and tear down a strip of spruce wood first before I go to
the bleaching-ground to dry the clothes; but if you go
alongside the hill you’ll come to a lot of lassies standing
washing clothes, and then you’ve not far to go to <i>Soria
Moria Castle</i>.”</p>
<p>In a little while <i>Halvor</i> came upon the lassies who
stood washing, and they asked if he had seen anything of
the West Wind who was to come and dry the clothes for
the wedding.</p>
<p>“Aye, aye, that I have,” said <i>Halvor</i>, “he’s only gone
to tear down a strip of spruce wood. It’ll not be long before
he’s here,” and then he asked them the way to <i>Soria
Moria Castle</i>.</p>
<p>So they put him into the right way, and when he got
to the Castle it was full of folk and horses; so full it made
one giddy to look at them. But <i>Halvor</i> was so ragged and
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_115" name="page_115"></a>115</span>
torn from having followed the West Wind through bush and
brier and bog, that he kept on one side, and wouldn’t show
himself till the last day when the bridal feast was to be.</p>
<p>So when all, as was then right and fitting, were to
drink the bride and bridegroom’s health and wish them
luck, and when the cupbearer was to drink to them all
again, both knights and squires, last of all he came in
turn to <i>Halvor</i>. He drank their health, but let the ring
which the <i>Princess</i> had put upon his finger as he lay by
the lake fall into the glass, and bade the cupbearer go and
greet the bride and hand her the glass.</p>
<p>Then up rose the <i>Princess</i> from the board at once.</p>
<p>“Who is most worthy to have one of us,” she said,
“he that has set us free, or he that here sits by me as
bridegroom?”</p>
<p>Well they all said there could be but one voice and
will as to that, and when <i>Halvor</i> heard that he wasn’t long
in throwing off his beggar’s rags, and arraying himself as
bridegroom.</p>
<p>“Aye, aye, here is the right one after all,” said the
youngest <i>Princess</i> as soon as she saw him, and so she tossed
the other one out of the window, and held her wedding
with <i>Halvor</i>.</p>

sons</i>, and he loved them so much that he could
never bear to be without them all at once, but
one must always be with him. Now, when they were
grown up, six were to set off to woo, but as for the
youngest, his father kept him at home, and the others
were to bring back a princess for him to the palace. So
the <i>King</i> gave the six the finest clothes you ever set eyes
on, so fine that the light gleamed from them a long way
off, and each had his horse, which cost many, many
hundred pounds, and so they set off. Now, when they
had been to many palaces, and seen many princesses, at
last they came to a <i>King</i> who had <i>six daughters</i>; such
lovely king’s daughters they had never seen, and so they
fell to wooing them, each one, and when they had got
them for sweethearts, they set off home again, but they
quite forgot that they were to bring back with them a
sweetheart for <i>Boots</i>, their brother, who stayed at home,
for they were over head and ears in love with their own
sweethearts.</p>

</p>
</div>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_118" name="page_118"></a>118</span></div>
<p>But when they had gone a good bit on their way, they
passed close by a steep hill-side, like a wall, where the
<i>Giant’s</i> house was, and there the <i>Giant</i> came out, and set
his eyes upon them, and turned them all into stone,
princes and princesses and all. Now the <i>King</i> waited
and waited for his <i>six sons</i>, but the more he waited, the
longer they stayed away; so he fell into great trouble, and
said he should never know what it was to be glad again.</p>
<p>“And if I had not you left,” he said to <i>Boots</i>, “I would
live no longer, so full of sorrow am I for the loss of your
brothers.”</p>
<p>“Well, but now I’ve been thinking to ask your leave
to set out and find them again; that’s what I’m thinking
of,” said <i>Boots</i>.</p>
<p>“Nay, nay!” said his father; “that leave you shall never
get, for then you would stay away too.”</p>
<p>But <i>Boots</i> had set his heart upon it; go he would; and
he begged and prayed so long that the <i>King</i> was forced to
let him go. Now, you must know the <i>King</i> had no other
horse to give <i>Boots</i> but an old broken-down jade, for his
six other sons and their train had carried off all his
horses; but <i>Boots</i> did not care a pin for that, he sprang
up on his sorry old steed.</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_119" name="page_119"></a>119</span></div>
<p>“Farewell,
father,” said he;
“I’ll come back,
never fear, and
like enough I shall
bring my six
brothers back with
me;” and with
that he rode off.</p>

</div>
<p>So, when he
had ridden a while,
he came to a
<i>Raven</i>, which lay
in the road and
flapped its wings, and was not able to get out of the way,
it was so starved.</p>
<p>“Oh, dear friend,” said the <i>Raven</i>, “give me a little
food, and I’ll help you again at your utmost need.”</p>
<p>“I haven’t much food,” said the <i>Prince</i>, “and I don’t
see how you’ll ever be able to help me much; but still I
can spare you a little. I see you want it.”</p>
<p>So he gave the raven some of the food he had brought
with him.</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_120" name="page_120"></a>120</span></div>
<p>Now, when he had gone a bit further, he came to a
brook, and in the brook lay a great <i>Salmon</i>, which had
got upon a dry place and dashed itself about, and could
not get into the water again.</p>
<p>“Oh, dear friend,” said the <i>Salmon</i> to the <i>Prince</i>;
“shove me out into the water again, and I’ll help you
again at your utmost need.”</p>
<p>“Well!” said the <i>Prince</i>, “the help you’ll give me will
not be great, I daresay, but it’s a pity you should lie there
and choke;” and with that he shot the fish out into the
stream again.</p>
<p>After that he went a long, long way, and there met
him a <i>Wolf</i> which was so famished that it lay and
crawled along the road on its belly.</p>
<p>“Dear friend, do let me have your horse,” said the
<i>Wolf</i>; “I’m so hungry the wind whistles through my ribs;
I’ve had nothing to eat these two years.”</p>
<p>“No,” said <i>Boots</i>, “this will never do; first I came to
a raven, and I was forced to give him my food; next I
came to a salmon, and him I had to help into the water
again; and now you will have my horse. It can’t be
done, that it can’t, for then I should have nothing to
ride on.”</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_121" name="page_121"></a>121</span></div>
<p>“Nay, dear friend, but you can help me,” said <i>Graylegs</i>
the wolf; “you can ride upon my back, and I’ll help you
again in your utmost need.”</p>
<p>“Well! the help I shall get from you will not be great,
I’ll be bound,” said the <i>Prince</i>; “but you may take my
horse, since you are in such need.”</p>
<p>So when the <i>Wolf</i> had eaten the horse, <i>Boots</i> took the
bit and put it into the <i>Wolf’s</i> jaw, and laid the saddle on
his back; and now the <i>Wolf</i> was so strong, after what he
had got inside, that he set off with the <i>Prince</i> like nothing.
So fast he had never ridden before.</p>
<p>“When we have gone a bit farther,” said <i>Graylegs</i>,
“I’ll show you the <i>Giant’s</i> house.”</p>
<p>So after a while they came to it.</p>
<p>“See, here is the <i>Giant’s</i> house,” said the <i>Wolf</i>; “and
see, here are your six brothers, whom the <i>Giant</i> has
turned into stone; and see, here are their six brides, and
away yonder is the door, and in that door you must go.”</p>
<p>“Nay, but I daren’t go in,” said the <i>Prince</i>; “he’ll
take my life.”</p>
<p>“No! no!” said the <i>Wolf</i>; “when you get in you’ll
find a <i>Princess</i>, and she’ll tell you what to do to make an
end of the <i>Giant</i>. Only mind and do as she bids you.”</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_122" name="page_122"></a>122</span></div>
<p>Well! <i>Boots</i> went in, but, truth to say, he was very
much afraid. When he came in the <i>Giant</i> was away,
but in one of the rooms sat the <i>Princess</i>, just as the <i>Wolf</i>
had said, and so lovely a princess <i>Boots</i> had never yet
set eyes on.</p>
<p>“Oh! heaven help you! whence have you come?” said
the <i>Princess</i>, as she saw him; “it will surely be your death.
No one can make an end of the <i>Giant</i> who lives here,
for he has no heart in his body.”</p>
<p>“Well! well!” said <i>Boots</i>; “but now that I am here, I
may as well try what I can do with him; and I will see
if I can’t free my brothers, who are standing turned to
stone out of doors; and you, too, I will try to save, that
I will.”</p>
<p>“Well, if you must, you must,” said the <i>Princess</i>;
“and so let us see if we can’t hit on a plan. Just
creep under the bed yonder, and mind and listen to
what he and I talk about. But, pray, do lie as still as a
mouse.”</p>
<p>So he crept under the bed, and he had scarce got well
underneath it, before the <i>Giant</i> came.</p>
<p>“Ha!” roared the <i>Giant</i>, “what a smell of Christian
blood there is in the house!”</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_123" name="page_123"></a>123</span></div>
<p>“Yes, I know there is,” said the <i>Princess</i>, “for there
came a magpie flying with a man’s bone, and let it fall
down the chimney. I made all the haste I could to get
it out, but all one can do, the smell doesn’t go off so
soon.”</p>
<p>So the <i>Giant</i> said no more about it, and when night
came, they went to bed. After they had lain a while,
the <i>Princess</i> said:</p>
<p>“There is one thing I’d be so glad to ask you about,
if I only dared.”</p>
<p>“What thing is that?” asked the <i>Giant</i>.</p>
<p>“Only where it is you keep your heart, since you don’t
carry it about you,” said the <i>Princess</i>.</p>
<p>“Ah! that’s a thing you’ve no business to ask about;
but if you must know, it lies under the door-sill,” said the
<i>Giant</i>.</p>
<p>“Ho! ho!” said <i>Boots</i> to himself under the bed, “then
we’ll soon see if we can’t find it.”</p>
<p>Next morning the <i>Giant</i> got up cruelly early, and
strode off to the wood; but he was hardly out of the house
before <i>Boots</i> and the <i>Princess</i> set to work to look under
the door-sill for his heart; but the more they dug, and the
more they hunted, the more they couldn’t find it.</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_124" name="page_124"></a>124</span></div>
<p>“He has baulked us this time,” said the <i>Princess</i>, “but
we’ll try him once more.”</p>
<p>So she picked all the prettiest flowers she could find,
and strewed them over the door-sill, which they had laid
in its right place again; and when the time came for the
<i>Giant</i> to come home again, <i>Boots</i> crept under the bed.
Just as he was well under, back came the <i>Giant</i>.</p>
<p>Snuff—snuff, went the <i>Giant’s</i> nose. “My eyes and
limbs, what a smell of Christian blood there is in here,”
said he.</p>
<p>“I know there is,” said the <i>Princess</i>, “for there came
a magpie flying with a man’s bone in his bill, and let it
fall down the chimney. I made as much haste as I could
to get it out, but I daresay it’s that you smell.”</p>
<p>So the <i>Giant</i> held his peace, and said no more about it.
A little while after, he asked who it was that had strewed
flowers about the door-sill.</p>
<p>“Oh, I, of course,” said the <i>Princess</i>.</p>
<p>“And, pray, what’s the meaning of all this?” said the
<i>Giant</i>.</p>
<p>“Ah!” said the <i>Princess</i>, “I’m so fond of you that I
couldn’t help strewing them, when I knew that your heart
lay under there.”</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_125" name="page_125"></a>125</span></div>
<p>“You don’t say so,” said the <i>Giant</i>; “but after all it
doesn’t lie there at all.”</p>
<p>So when they went to bed again in the evening, the
<i>Princess</i> asked the <i>Giant</i> again where his heart was, for she
said she would so like to know.</p>
<p>“Well,” said the <i>Giant</i>, “if you must know, it lies
away yonder in the cupboard against the wall.”</p>
<p>“So, so!” thought <i>Boots</i> and the <i>Princess</i>; “then we’ll
soon try to find it.”</p>
<p>Next morning the <i>Giant</i> was away early, and strode off
to the wood, and so soon as he was gone <i>Boots</i> and the
<i>Princess</i> were in the cupboard hunting for his heart, but the
more they sought for it, the less they found it.</p>
<p>“Well,” said the <i>Princess</i>, “we’ll just try him once
more.”</p>
<p>So she decked out the cupboard with flowers and garlands,
and when the time came for the <i>Giant</i> to come
home, <i>Boots</i> crept under the bed again.</p>
<p>Then back came the <a name="TC_7"></a><ins class="trchange" title="Added italics"><i>Giant</i></ins>.</p>
<p>Snuff—snuff! “My eyes and limbs, what a smell of
Christian blood there is in here!”</p>
<p>“I know there is,” said the <i>Princess</i>; “for a little while
since there came a magpie flying with a man’s bone in his
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_126" name="page_126"></a>126</span>
bill, and let it fall down the chimney. I made all the
haste I could to get it out of the house again; but after
all my pains, I daresay it’s that you smell.”</p>
<p>When the <i>Giant</i> heard that, he said no more about it;
but a little while after, he saw how the cupboard was all
decked about with flowers and garlands; so he asked who
it was that had done that? Who could it be but the <i>Princess</i>?</p>
<p>“And, pray, what’s the meaning of all this tomfoolery?”
asked the <i>Giant</i>.</p>
<p>“Oh, I’m so fond of you, I couldn’t help doing it
when I knew that your heart lay there,” said the <i>Princess</i>.</p>
<p>“How can you be so silly as to believe any such thing?”
said the <i>Giant</i>.</p>
<p>“Oh yes; how can I help believing it, when you say
it?” said the <i>Princess</i>.</p>
<p>“You’re a goose,” said the <i>Giant</i>; “where my heart
is, you will never come.”</p>
<p>“Well,” said the <i>Princess</i>; “but for all that, ’twould
be such a pleasure to know where it really lies.”</p>
<p>Then the poor <i>Giant</i> could hold out no longer, but
was forced to say:</p>

<i>He took a long, long farewell of the Princess, and when he got out of the Giant’s door, there stood the Wolf waiting for him.</i><br>
</p>
</div>
<p>“Yes! now I must set off too,” said <i>Boots</i>; “if I only
knew how to find the way.” He took a long, long farewell
of the <i>Princess</i>, and when he got out of the <i>Giant’s</i>
door, there stood the <i>Wolf</i> waiting for him. So <i>Boots</i>
told him all that had happened inside the house, and said
now he wished to ride to the well in the church, if he
only knew the way. So the <i>Wolf</i> bade him jump on his
back, he’d soon find the way; and away they went, till
the wind whistled after them, over hedge and field, over
hill and dale. After they had travelled many, many days,
they came at last to the lake. Then the <i>Prince</i> did not
know how to get over it, but the <i>Wolf</i> bade him only
not be afraid, but stick on, and so he jumped into the
lake with the <i>Prince</i> on his back, and swam over to the
island. So they came to the church; but the church
keys hung high, high up on the top of the tower, and
at first the <i>Prince</i> did not know how to get them
down.</p>
<p>“You must call on the raven,” said the <i>Wolf</i>.</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_128" name="page_128"></a>128</span></div>
<p>So the <i>Prince</i> called on the raven, and in a trice the
raven came, and flew up and fetched the keys, and so the
<i>Prince</i> got into the church. But when he came to the
well, there lay the duck, and swam about backwards and
forwards, just as the <i>Giant</i> had said. So the <i>Prince</i> stood
and coaxed it, till it came to him, and he grasped it in
his hand; but just as he lifted it up from the water the
duck dropped the egg into the well, and then <i>Boots</i> was
beside himself to know how to get it out again.</p>
<p>“Well, now you must call on the salmon to be sure,”
said the <i>Wolf</i>; and the king’s son called on the salmon,
and the salmon came and fetched up the egg from the
bottom of the well.</p>
<p>Then the <i>Wolf</i> told him to squeeze the egg, and as
soon as ever he squeezed it the <i>Giant</i> screamed out.</p>
<p>“Squeeze it again,” said the <i>Wolf</i>; and when the
<i>Prince</i> did so, the <i>Giant</i> screamed still more piteously,
and begged and prayed so prettily to be spared, saying he
would do all that the <i>Prince</i> wished if he would only not
squeeze his heart in two.</p>
<p>“Tell him, if he will restore to life again your six
brothers and their brides, whom he has turned to stone,
you will spare his life,” said the <i>Wolf</i>. Yes, the <i>Giant</i>
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_129" name="page_129"></a>129</span>
was ready to do that, and he turned the six brothers into
king’s sons again, and their brides into king’s daughters.</p>
<p>“Now, squeeze the egg in two,” said the <i>Wolf</i>. So
<i>Boots</i> squeezed the egg to pieces, and the <i>Giant</i> burst at
once.</p>
<p>Now, when he had made an end of the <i>Giant</i>, <i>Boots</i>
rode back again on the <i>Wolf</i> to the <i>Giant’s</i> house, and
there stood all his six brothers alive and merry, with their
brides. Then <i>Boots</i> went into the hill-side after his bride,
and so they all set off home again to their father’s house.
And you may fancy how glad the old king was when he
saw all his seven sons come back, each with his bride—“But
the loveliest bride of all is the bride of <i>Boots</i>, after
all,” said the king, “and he shall sit uppermost at the
table, with her by his side.”</p>
<p>So he sent out, and called a great wedding-feast, and
the mirth was both loud and long, and if they have not
done feasting, why, they are still at it.</p>

meadow, which lay high up on the hill-side,
and in the meadow was a barn, which he had
built to keep his hay in. Now, I must tell you, there
hadn’t been much in the barn for the last year or two, for
every St. John’s night, when the grass stood greenest and
deepest, the meadow was eaten down to the very ground
the next morning, just as if a whole drove of sheep had
been there feeding on it over night. This happened once,
and it happened twice; so at last the man grew weary of
losing his crop of hay, and said to his sons—for he had
three of them, and the youngest was nicknamed <i>Boots</i>, of
course—that now one of them must go and sleep in the
barn in the outlying field when St. John’s night came, for
it was too good a joke that his grass should be eaten, root
and blade, this year, as it had been the last two years. So
whichever of them went must keep a sharp look-out; that
was what their father said.</p>
<p>Well, the eldest son was ready to go and watch the
meadow; trust him for looking after the grass! It shouldn’t
be his fault if man or beast, or the fiend himself, got a blade
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_132" name="page_132"></a>132</span>
of grass. So, when evening came, he set off to the barn,
and lay down to sleep; but a little on in the night came
such a clatter, and such an earthquake, that walls and roof
shook, and groaned, and creaked; then up jumped the lad,
and took to his heels as fast as ever he could; nor dared he
once look round till he reached home; and as for the hay,
why it was eaten up this year just as it had been twice before.</p>
<p>The next St. John’s night, the man said again, it would
never do to lose all the grass in the outlying field year after
year in this way, so one of his sons must just trudge off to
watch it, and watch it well too. Well, the next oldest son
was ready to try his luck, so he set off, and lay down to
sleep in the barn as his brother had done before him; but
as the night wore on, there came on a rumbling and quaking
of the earth, worse even than on the last St. John’s night,
and when the lad heard it, he got frightened, and took to
his heels as though he were running a race.</p>
<p>Next year the turn came to <i>Boots</i>; but when he made
ready to go, the other two began to laugh and to make
game of him, saying:</p>
<p>“You’re just the man to watch the hay, that you are;
you, who have done nothing all your life but sit in the
ashes and toast yourself by the fire.”</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_133" name="page_133"></a>133</span></div>
<p>But <i>Boots</i> did not care a pin for their chattering, and
stumped away as evening grew on, up the hill-side to the
outlying field. There he went inside the barn and lay
down; but in about an hour’s time the barn began to
groan and creak, so that it was dreadful to hear.</p>
<p>“Well,” said <i>Boots</i> to himself, “if it isn’t worse than
this, I can stand it well enough.”</p>
<p>A little while after came another creak and an earthquake,
so that the litter in the barn flew about the lad’s ears.
“Oh!” said <i>Boots</i> to himself, “if it isn’t worse than this,
I daresay I can stand it out.”</p>
<p>But just then came a third rumbling, and a third earthquake,
so that the lad thought walls and roof were coming
down on his head; but it passed off, and all was still as
death about him.</p>
<p>“It’ll come again, I’ll be bound,” thought <i>Boots</i>; but
no, it didn’t come again; still it was, and still it stayed; but
after he had lain a little while, he heard a noise as if a horse
were standing just outside the barn-door, and cropping the
grass. He stole to the door, and peeped through a chink,
and there stood a horse feeding away. So big, and fat,
and grand a horse, <i>Boots</i> had never set eyes on; by his side
on the grass lay a saddle and bridle, and a full set of armour
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_134" name="page_134"></a>134</span>
for a knight, all of brass, so bright that the light gleamed
from it.</p>
<p>“Ho, ho!” thought the lad; “it’s you, is it, that eats
up our hay? I’ll soon put a spoke in your wheel, just see
if I don’t.”</p>
<p>So he lost no time, but took the steel out of his tinder-box,
and threw it over the horse; then it had no power to
stir from the spot, and became so tame that the lad could
do what he liked with it. So he got on its back, and rode
off with it to a place which no one knew of, and there he
put up the horse. When he got home, his brothers
laughed and asked how he had fared?</p>
<p>“You didn’t lie long in the barn, even if you had the
heart to go so far as the field.”</p>
<p>“Well,” said <i>Boots</i>, “all I can say is, I lay in the barn
till the sun rose, and neither saw nor heard anything; I
can’t think what there was in the barn to make you both so
afraid.”</p>
<p>“A pretty story,” said his brothers; “but we’ll soon
see how you have watched the meadow;” so they set off;
but when they reached it, there stood the grass as deep and
thick as it had been over night.</p>
<p>Well, the next St. John’s eve it was the same story over
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_135" name="page_135"></a>135</span>
again; neither of the elder brothers dared to go out to the
outlying field to watch the crop; but <i>Boots</i>, he had the
heart to go, and everything happened just as it had happened
the year before. First a clatter and an earthquake, then a
greater clatter and another earthquake, and so on a third
time; only this year the earthquakes were far worse than
the year before. Then all at once everything was as
still as death, and the lad heard how something was cropping
the grass outside the barn-door, so he stole to the door,
and peeped through a chink; and what do you think he
saw? Why, another horse standing right up against the
wall, and chewing and champing with might and main.
It was far finer and fatter than that which came the year
before, and it had a saddle on its back, and a bridle on its
neck, and a full suit of mail for a knight lay by its side,
all of silver, and as grand as you would wish to see.</p>
<p>“Ho, ho!” said <i>Boots</i> to himself; “it’s you that
gobbles up our hay, is it? I’ll soon put a spoke in your
wheel;” and with that he took the steel out of his tinder-box,
and threw it over the horse’s crest, which stood as
still as a lamb. Well, the lad rode this horse, too, to the
hiding-place where he kept the other one, and after that
he went home.</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_136" name="page_136"></a>136</span></div>
<p>“I suppose you’ll tell us,” said one of his brothers,
“there’s a fine crop this year too, up in the hayfield.”</p>
<p>“Well, so there is,” said <i>Boots</i>; and off ran the others
to see, and there stood the grass thick and deep, as it was
the year before; but they didn’t give <i>Boots</i> softer words for
all that.</p>
<p>Now, when the third St. John’s eve came, the two elder
brothers still hadn’t the heart to lie out in the barn and watch
the grass, for they had got so scared at heart the nights they
lay there before, that they couldn’t get over the fright; but
<i>Boots</i>, he dared to go; and, to make a very long story short,
the very same thing happened this time as had happened
twice before. Three earthquakes came, one after the
other, each worse than the one which went before, and
when the last came, the lad danced about with the shock
from one barn wall to the other; and after that, all at
once, it was still as death. Now when he had laid a little
while, he heard something tugging away at the grass
outside the barn, so he stole again to the door-chink, and
peeped out, and there stood a horse close outside—far, far
bigger and fatter than the two he had taken before.</p>
<p>“Ho, ho!” said the lad to himself, “it’s you, is it,
that comes here eating up our hay? I’ll soon stop that—I’ll
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_137" name="page_137"></a>137</span>
soon put a spoke in your wheel.” So he caught up
his steel and threw it over his horse’s neck, and in a trice
it stood as if it were nailed to the ground, and <i>Boots</i>
could do as he pleased with it. Then he rode off with
it to the hiding-place where he kept the other two, and
then went home. When he got home, his two brothers
made game of him as they had done before, saying, they
could see he had watched the grass well, for he looked
for all the world as if he were walking in his sleep, and
many other spiteful things they said, but <i>Boots</i> gave no
heed to them, only asking them to go and see for themselves;
and when they went, there stood the grass as fine
and deep this time as it had been twice before.</p>
<p>Now, you must know that the king of the country
where <i>Boots</i> lived had a daughter, whom he would only
give to the man who could ride up over the hill of glass,
for there was a high, high hill, all of glass, as smooth and
slippery as ice, close by the <i>King’s</i> palace. Upon the
tip top of the hill the <i>King’s</i> daughter was to sit, with
three golden apples in her lap, and the man who could
ride up and carry off the three golden apples, was to
have half the kingdom, and the <i>Princess</i> to wife. This
the <i>King</i> had stuck up on all the church-doors in his
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_138" name="page_138"></a>138</span>
realm, and had
given it out in
many other kingdoms
besides.
Now, this <i>Princess</i>
was so lovely that
all who set eyes on
her fell over head
and ears in love
with her whether
they would or no.
So I needn’t tell
you how all the
princes and
knights who heard of her were eager to win her to wife,
and half the kingdom beside; and how they came riding
from all parts of the world on high prancing horses, and
clad in the grandest clothes, for there wasn’t one of them
who hadn’t made up his mind that he, and he alone, was
to win the <i>Princess</i>.</p>
<div class="figtag">
<a name="linki_41" id="linki_41"></a>
</div>
<div class="figright" style="width:250px">
<img src="./eastofthesunwestofthemoon_files/gs19.png" alt="" title="" width="250" height="276"><br>
</div>
<p>So when the day of trial came, which the king had
fixed, there was such a crowd of princes and knights under
the <i>Glass Hill</i>, that it made one’s head whirl to look at
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_139" name="page_139"></a>139</span>
them, and everyone in the country who could even crawl
along was off to the hill, for they were all eager to see
the man who was to win the <i>Princess</i>. So the two elder
brothers set off with the rest; but as for <i>Boots</i>, they said
outright he shouldn’t go with them, for if they were seen
with such a dirty changeling, all begrimed with smut from
cleaning their shoes and sifting cinders in the dust-hole,
they said folk would make game of them.</p>
<p>“Very well,” said <i>Boots</i>, “it’s all one to me. I can go
alone, and stand or fall by myself.”</p>
<p>Now when the two brothers came to the <i>Hill of Glass</i>,
the knights and princes were all hard at it, riding their
horses till they were all in a foam; but it was no good, by
my troth; for as soon as ever the horses set foot on the hill,
down they slipped, and there wasn’t one who could get
a yard or two up; and no wonder, for the hill was as
smooth as a sheet of glass, and as steep as a house-wall.
But all were eager to have the <i>Princess</i> and half the kingdom.
So they rode and slipped, and slipped and rode,
and still it was the same story over again. At last all
their horses were so weary that they could scarce lift a
leg, and in such a sweat that the lather dripped from them,
and so the knights had to give up trying any more. So the
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_140" name="page_140"></a>140</span>
king was just thinking that he would proclaim a new trial
for the next day, to see if they would have better luck,
when all at once a knight came riding up on so brave a
steed, that no one had ever seen the like of it in his born
days, and the knight had mail of brass, and the horse a brass
bit in his mouth, so bright that the sunbeams shone from it.
Then all the others called out to him he might just as well
spare himself the trouble of riding at the Hill, for it would
lead to no good; but he gave no heed to them, and put his
horse at the hill, and went up it like nothing for a good
way, about a third of the height; and when he had got so
far, he turned his horse round and rode down again. So
lovely a knight the <i>Princess</i> thought she had never yet seen;
and while he was riding, she sat and thought to herself:</p>
<p>“Would to heaven he might only come up and down
the other side.”</p>
<p>And when she saw him turning back, she threw down
one of the golden apples after him, and it rolled down into
his shoe. But when he got to the bottom of the hill, he
rode off so fast that no one could tell what had become of
him. That evening all the knights and princes were to go
before the king, that he who had ridden so far up the hill
might show the apple which the <i>Princess</i> had thrown, but
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_141" name="page_141"></a>141</span>
there was no one who had anything to show. One after
the other they all came, but not a man of them could show
the apple.</p>
<p>At even the brothers of <i>Boots</i> came home too, and had
such a long story to tell about the riding up the hill.</p>
<p>“First of all,” they said, “there was not one of the
whole lot who could get so much as a stride up; but at last
came one who had a suit of brass mail, and a brass bridle
and saddle, all so bright that the sun shone from them a mile
off. He was a chap to ride, just! He rode a third of the
way up the <i>Hill of Glass</i>, and he could easily have ridden
the whole way up, if he chose; but he turned round and
rode down, thinking, maybe, that was enough for once.”</p>
<p>“Oh! I should so like to have seen him, that I should,”
said <i>Boots</i>, who sat by the fireside, and stuck his feet into
the cinders, as was his wont.</p>
<p>“Oh!” said his brothers, “you would, would you?
You look fit to keep company with such high lords, nasty
beast that you are, sitting there amongst the ashes.”</p>
<p>Next day the brothers were all for setting off again, and
<i>Boots</i> begged them this time, too, to let him go with them
and see the riding; but no, they wouldn’t have him at any
price, he was too ugly and nasty, they said.</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_142" name="page_142"></a>142</span></div>
<p>“Well, well!” said <i>Boots</i>; “if I go at all, I must go by
myself. I’m not afraid.”</p>
<p>So when the brothers got to the <i>Hill of Glass</i>, all the
princes and knights began to ride again, and you may fancy
they had taken care to shoe their horses sharp; but it was
no good—they rode and slipped, and slipped and rode, just
as they had done the day before, and there was not one who
could get so far as a yard up the hill. And when they had
worn out their horses, so that they could not stir a leg, they
were all forced to give it up as a bad job. So the king
thought he might as well proclaim that the riding should
take place the day after for the last time, just to give them
one chance more; but all at once it came across his mind
that he might as well wait a little longer, to see if the knight
in brass mail would come this day too. Well, they saw
nothing of him; but all at once came one riding on a steed,
far, far braver and finer than that on which the knight in
brass had ridden, and he had silver mail, and a silver saddle
and bridle, all so bright that the sunbeams gleamed and
glanced from them far away. Then the others shouted
out to him again, saying, he might as well hold hard, and
not try to ride up the hill, for all his trouble would be
thrown away; but the knight paid no heed to them, and
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_143" name="page_143"></a>143</span>
rode straight at the hill, and right up it, till he had gone
two-thirds of the way, and then he wheeled his horse
round and rode down again. To tell the truth, the
<i>Princess</i> liked him still better than the knight in brass, and
she sat and wished he might only be able to come right
up to the top, and down the other side; but when she
saw him turning back, she threw the second apple after
him, and it rolled down and fell into his shoe. But, as
soon as ever he had come down from the <i>Hill of Glass</i>, he
rode off so fast that no one could see what became of him.</p>
<p>At even, when all were to go in before the king and
the <i>Princess</i>, that he who had the golden apple might show
it, in they went, one after the other, but there was no one
who had any apple to show, and the two brothers, as they
had done on the former day, went home and told how
things had gone, and how all had ridden at the hill, and
none got up.</p>
<p>“But, last of all,” they said, “came one in a silver
suit, and his horse had a silver saddle and a silver bridle.
He was just a chap to ride; and he got two-thirds up the
hill, and then turned back. He was a fine fellow, and no
mistake; and the <i>Princess</i> threw the second gold apple to
him.”</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_144" name="page_144"></a>144</span></div>
<p>“Oh!” said <i>Boots</i>, “I should so like to have seen him
too, that I should.”</p>
<p>“A pretty story,” they said. “Perhaps you think
his coat of mail was as bright as the ashes you are always
poking about, and sifting, you nasty dirty beast.”</p>
<p>The third day everything happened as it had happened
the two days before. <i>Boots</i> begged to go and see the
sight, but the two wouldn’t hear of his going with them.
When they got to the hill there was no one who could
get so much as a yard up it; and now all waited for the
knight in silver mail, but they neither saw nor heard of
him. At last came one riding on a steed, so brave that
no one had ever seen his match; and the knight had a
suit of golden mail, and a golden saddle and bridle, so
wondrous bright that the sunbeams gleamed from them
a mile off. The other knights and princes could not
find time to call out to him not to try his luck, for they
were amazed to see how grand he was. So he rode
right at the hill, and tore up it like nothing, so that the
<i>Princess</i> hadn’t even time to wish that he might get up
the whole way. As soon as ever he reached the top, he
took the third golden apple from the <i>Princess’</i> lap, and
then turned his horse and rode down again. As soon as
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_145" name="page_145"></a>145</span>
he got down, he rode off at full speed, and was out of
sight in no time.</p>
<p>Now, when the brothers got home at even, you may
fancy what long stories they told, how the riding had
gone off that day; and amongst other things, they had
a deal to say about the knight in golden mail.</p>
<p>“He just was a chap to ride!” they said; “so grand a
knight isn’t to be found in the wide world.”</p>
<p>“Oh!” said <i>Boots</i>, “I should so like to have seen him,
that I should.”</p>
<p>“Ah!” said his brothers, “his mail shone a deal
brighter than the glowing coals which you are always
poking and digging at; nasty dirty beast that you
are.”</p>
<p>Next day all the knights and princes were to pass before
the king and the <i>Princess</i>—it was too late to do so
the night before, I suppose—that he who had the gold
apple might bring it forth; but one came after another,
first the <i>Princes</i>, and then the knights, and still no one could
show the gold apple.</p>
<p>“Well,” said the king, “some one must have it, for
it was something we all saw with our own eyes, how a
man came and rode up and bore it off.”</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_146" name="page_146"></a>146</span></div>
<p>So he commanded that every man who was in the
kingdom should come up to the palace and see if they
could show the apple. Well, they all came one after
another, but no one had the golden apple, and after a long
time the two brothers of <i>Boots</i> came. They were the last
of all, so the king asked them if there was no one else in
the kingdom who hadn’t come.</p>
<p>“Oh, yes,” said they; “we have a brother, but he
never carried off the golden apple. He hasn’t stirred out
of the dusthole on any of the three days.”</p>
<p>“Never mind that,” said the king; “he may as well
come up to the palace like the rest.”</p>
<p>So <i>Boots</i> had to go up to the palace.</p>
<p>“How now,” said the king; “have you got the golden
apple? Speak out!”</p>
<p>“Yes, I have,” said <i>Boots</i>; “here is the first, and
here is the second, and here is the third too;” and with
that he pulled all three golden apples out of his pocket, and
at the same time threw off his sooty rags, and stood before
them in his gleaming golden mail.</p>
<p>“Yes!” said the king; “you shall have my daughter,
and half my kingdom, for you well deserve both her
and it.”</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_147" name="page_147"></a>147</span></div>
<p>So they got ready for the wedding, and <i>Boots</i> got the
<i>Princess</i> to wife, and there was great merry-making at the
bridal-feast, you may fancy, for they could all be merry
though they couldn’t ride up the <i>Hill of Glass</i>; and all I
can say is, if they haven’t left off their merry-making yet,
why, they’re still at it.</p>

who had an only <i>Son</i>. She dragged on with the
boy till he had been confirmed, and then she
said she couldn’t feed him any longer, he must just go out
and earn his own bread. So the lad wandered out into
the world, and when he had walked a day or so, a strange
man met him.</p>
<p>“Whither away?” asked the man.</p>
<div class="figtag">

<p class="caption">
<i>When he had walked a day or so, a strange man met him. “Whither away?” asked the man.</i><br>
</p>
</div>
<p>“Oh, I’m going out into the world to try and get a
place,” said the lad.</p>
<p>“Will you come and serve me?” said the man.</p>
<p>“Oh, yes; just as soon you as any one else,” said
the lad.</p>
<p>“Well, you’ll have a good place with me,” said the
man; “for you’ll only have to keep me company, and do
nothing at all else beside.”</p>
<p>So the lad stopped with him, and lived on the fat
of the land, both in meat and drink, and had little or
nothing to do; but he never saw a living soul in that
man’s house.</p>
<p>So one day the man said:</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_150" name="page_150"></a>150</span></div>
<p>“Now, I’m going off for eight days, and that time
you’ll have to spend here all alone; but you must not go
into any one of these four rooms here. If you do, I’ll
take your life when I come back.”</p>
<p>“No,” said the lad, he’d be sure not to do that. But
when the man had been gone three or four days, the lad
couldn’t bear it any longer, but went into the first room,
and when he got inside he looked round, but he saw
nothing but a shelf over the door where a bramble-bush
rod lay.</p>
<p>Well, indeed! thought the lad; a pretty thing to
forbid my seeing this.</p>
<p>So when the eight days were out, the man came home,
and the first thing he said was:</p>
<p>“You haven’t been into any of these rooms, of
course.”</p>
<p>“No, no; that I haven’t,” said the lad.</p>
<p>“I’ll soon see that,” said the man, and went at once
into the room where the lad had been.</p>
<p>“Nay, but you have been in here,” said he; “and
now you shall lose your life.”</p>
<p>Then the lad begged and prayed so hard that he got
off with his life, but the man gave him a good thrashing.
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_151" name="page_151"></a>151</span>
And when it was over, they were as good friends as ever.</p>
<p>Some time after the man set off again, and said he
should be away fourteen days; but before he went he
forbade the lad to go into any of the rooms he had not
been in before; as for that he had been in, he might go
into that, and welcome. Well, it was the same story
over again, except that the lad stood out eight days before
he went in. In this room, too, he saw nothing but a
shelf over the door, and a big stone, and a pitcher of
water on it. Well, after all, there’s not much to be
afraid of my seeing here, thought the lad.</p>
<p>But when the man came back, he asked if he had
been into any of the rooms. No, the lad hadn’t done
anything of the kind.</p>
<p>“Well, well; I’ll soon see that,” said the man; and
when he saw the lad had been in them after all, he said:</p>
<p>“Ah! now I’ll spare you no longer; now you must
lose your life.”</p>
<p>But the lad begged and prayed for himself again,
and so this time too he got off with stripes; though he
got as many as his skin would carry. But when he got
sound and well again, he led just as easy a life as ever,
and he and the man were just as good friends.</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_152" name="page_152"></a>152</span></div>
<p>So a while after the man was to take another journey,
and now he said he should be away three weeks, and he
forbade the lad anew to go into the third room, for if
he went in there he might just make up his mind at once
to lose his life. Then after fourteen days the lad couldn’t
bear it, but crept into the room, but he saw nothing at
all in there but a trap door on the floor; and when he
lifted it up and looked down, there stood a great copper
cauldron which bubbled up and boiled away down there;
but he saw no fire under it.</p>
<p>“Well, I should just like to know if it’s hot,” thought
the lad, and struck his finger down into the broth, and
when he pulled it out again, lo! it was gilded all over.
So the lad scraped and scrubbed it, but the gilding
wouldn’t go off, so he bound a piece of rag round it;
and when the man came back, and asked what was the
matter with his finger, the lad said he’d given it such a
bad cut. But the man tore off the rag, and then he
soon saw what was the matter with the finger. First he
wanted to kill the lad outright, but when he wept, and
begged, he only gave him such a thrashing that he had
to keep his bed three days. After that the man took
down a pot from the wall, and rubbed him over with
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_153" name="page_153"></a>153</span>
some stuff out of it, and so the lad was as sound and
fresh as ever.</p>
<p>So after a while the man started off again, and this
time he was to be away a month. But before he went,
he said to the lad, if he went into the fourth room he
might give up all hope of saving his life.</p>
<p>Well, the lad stood out for two or three weeks, but
then he couldn’t hold out any longer; he must and
would go into that room, and so in he stole. There
stood a great black horse tied up in a stall by himself,
with a manger of red-hot coals at his head and a truss
of hay at his tail. Then the lad thought this all wrong,
so he changed them about, and put the hay at his head.
Then said the <i>Horse</i>:</p>
<p>“Since you are so good at heart as to let me have
some food, I’ll set you free, that I will. For if the
<i>Troll</i> comes back and finds you here, he’ll kill you outright.
But now you must go up to the room which
lies just over this, and take a coat of mail out of those
that hang there; and mind, whatever you do, don’t take
any of the bright ones, but the most rusty of all you
see, that’s the one to take; and sword and saddle you
must choose for yourself just in the same way.”</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_154" name="page_154"></a>154</span></div>
<p>So the lad did all that; but it was a heavy load for
him to carry them all down at once.</p>
<p>When he came back, the <i>Horse</i> told him to pull off
his clothes and get into the cauldron which stood and
boiled in the other room, and bathe himself there. “If
I do,” thought the lad, “I shall look an awful fright;”
but for all that, he did as he was told. So when he had
taken his bath, he became so handsome and sleek, and
as red and white as milk and blood, and much stronger
than he had been before.</p>
<p>“Do you feel any change?” asked the <i>Horse</i>.</p>
<p>“Yes,” said the lad.</p>
<p>“Try and lift me, then,” said the <i>Horse</i>.</p>
<p>Oh yes! he could do that, and as for the sword, he
brandished it like a feather.</p>
<p>“Now saddle me,” said the <i>Horse</i>, “and put on the
coat of mail, and then take the bramble-bush rod, and
the stone, and the pitcher of water, and the pot of
ointment, and then we’ll be off as fast as we can.”</p>
<p>So when the lad had got on the horse, off they went
at such a rate, he couldn’t at all tell how they went. But
when he had ridden awhile, the <i>Horse</i> said, “I think I
hear a noise; look round! can you see anything?”</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_155" name="page_155"></a>155</span></div>
<p>“Yes; there are ever so many coming after us, at
least a score,” said the lad.</p>
<p>“Aye, aye, that’s the <i>Troll</i> coming,” said the <i>Horse</i>;
“now he’s after us with his pack.”</p>
<p>So they rode on a while, until those who followed
were close behind them.</p>
<p>“Now throw your bramble-bush rod behind you,
over your shoulder,” said the <i>Horse</i>; “but mind you
throw it a good way off my back.”</p>
<p>So the lad did that, and all at once a close, thick
bramblewood grew up behind them. So the lad rode on
a long, long time, while the <i>Troll</i> and his crew had to go
home to fetch something to hew their way through the
wood. But at last the <i>Horse</i> said <a name="TC_8"></a><ins class="trchange" title="Was &#39;again.&#39;">again:</ins></p>
<p>“Look behind you! can you see anything now?”</p>
<p>“Yes, ever so many,” said the lad, “as many as would
fill a large church.”</p>
<p>“Aye, aye, that’s the <i>Troll</i> and his crew,” said the
<i>Horse</i>; “now he’s got more to back him; but now throw
down the stone, and mind you throw it far behind me.”</p>
<p>And as soon as the lad did what the <i>Horse</i> said, up
rose a great black hill of rock behind him. So the <i>Troll</i>
had to be off home to fetch something to mine his way
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_156" name="page_156"></a>156</span>
through the rock; and while the <i>Troll</i> did that, the lad
rode a good bit further on. But still the <i>Horse</i> begged
him to look behind him, and then he saw a troop like a
whole army behind him, and they glistened in the sunbeams.</p>

<i>But still the Horse begged him to look behind him.</i><br>
</p>
</div>
<p>“Aye, aye,” said the <i>Horse</i>, “that’s the <i>Troll</i>, and
now he’s got his whole band with him, so throw the
pitcher of water behind you, but mind you don’t spill
any of it upon me.”</p>
<p>So the lad did that; but in spite of all the pains he
took, he still spilt one drop on the horse’s flank. So it
became a great deep lake; and because of that one drop,
the horse found himself far out in it, but still he swam
safe to land. But when the <i>Trolls</i> came to the lake, they
lay down to drink it dry; and so they swilled and swilled
till they burst.</p>
<p>“Now we’re rid of them,” said the <i>Horse</i>.</p>
<p>So when they had gone a long, long while, they came
to a green patch in a wood.</p>
<p>“Now, strip off all your arms,” said the <i>Horse</i>, “and
only put on your ragged clothes, and take the saddle off
me, and let me loose, and hang all my clothing and
your arms up inside that great hollow lime-tree yonder.
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_157" name="page_157"></a>157</span>
Then make yourself a wig of fir-moss, and go up to the
king’s palace, which lies close here, and ask for a place.
Whenever you need me, only come here and shake the
bridle, and I’ll come to you.”</p>
<p>Yes! the lad did all his <i>Horse</i> told him, and as soon
as ever he put on the wig of moss he became so ugly, and
pale, and miserable to look at, no one would have known
him again. Then he went up to the king’s palace and
begged first for leave to be in the kitchen, and bring in
wood and water for the cook, but then the kitchen-maid
asked him:</p>
<p>“Why do you wear that ugly wig? Off with it.
I won’t have such a fright in here.”</p>
<p>“No, I can’t do that,” said the lad; “for I’m not
quite right in my head.”</p>
<p>“Do you think then I’ll have you in here about the
food,” cried the cook. “Away with you to the coachman;
you’re best fit to go and clean the stable.”</p>
<p>But when the coachman begged him to take his wig
off, he got the same answer, and he wouldn’t have him
either.</p>
<p>“You’d best go down to the gardener,” said he;
“you’re best fit to go about and dig in the garden.”</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_158" name="page_158"></a>158</span></div>
<div class="figtag">

<div class="figright" style="width:250px">
<img src="./eastofthesunwestofthemoon_files/gs20.png" alt="" title="" width="250" height="278"><br>
</div>
<p>So he got leave
to be with the gardener,
but none of
the other servants
would sleep with
him, and so he had
to sleep by himself
under the steps of
the summer-house.
It stood upon
beams, and had a
high staircase.
Under that he got
some turf for his
bed, and there he lay as well as he could.</p>
<p>So, when he had been some time at the palace, it
happened one morning, just as the sun rose, that the lad
had taken off his wig, and stood and washed himself,
and then he was so handsome, it was a joy to look at him.</p>
<p>So the <i>Princess</i> saw from her window the lovely
gardener’s boy, and thought she had never seen any one
so handsome. Then she asked the gardener why he lay
out there under the steps.</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_159" name="page_159"></a>159</span></div>
<p>“Oh,” said the gardener, “none of his fellow-servants
will sleep with him; that’s why.”</p>
<p>“Let him come up to-night, and lie at the door
inside my bedroom, and then they’ll not refuse to sleep
with him any more,” said the <i>Princess</i>.</p>
<p>So the gardener told that to the lad.</p>
<p>“Do you think I’ll do any such thing?” said the
lad. “Why they’d say next there was something between
me and the <i>Princess</i>.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said the gardener, “you’ve good reason to
fear any such thing, you who are so handsome.”</p>
<p>“Well, well,” said the lad, “since it’s her will, I
suppose I must go.”</p>
<p>So, when he was to go up the steps in the evening,
he tramped and stamped so on the way, that they had
to beg him to tread softly lest the <i>King</i> should come to
know it. So he came into the <i>Princess’</i> bedroom, lay
down, and began to snore at once. Then the <i>Princess</i>
said to her maid:</p>
<p>“Go gently, and just pull his wig off;” and she
went up to him.</p>
<p>But just as she was going to whisk it off, he caught
hold of it with both hands, and said she should never
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_160" name="page_160"></a>160</span>
have it. After that he lay down again, and began to
snore. Then the <i>Princess</i> gave her maid a wink, and
this time she whisked off the wig; and there lay the lad
so lovely, and white and red, just as the <i>Princess</i> had
seen him in the morning sun.</p>
<div class="figtag">

<i>And this time she whisked off the wig; and there lay the lad, so lovely, and white and red, just as the Princess had seen him in the morning sun.</i><br>
</p>
</div>
<p>After that the lad slept every night in the <i>Princess’</i>
bedroom.</p>
<p>But it wasn’t long before the <i>King</i> came to hear how
the gardener’s lad slept every night in the <i>Princess’</i> bedroom;
and he got so wroth he almost took the lad’s life.
He didn’t do that, however, but he threw him into the
prison tower; and as for his daughter, he shut her up
in her own room, whence she never got leave to stir day
or night. All that she begged, and all that she prayed,
for the lad and herself, was no good. The <i>King</i> was
only more wroth than ever.</p>
<p>Some time after came a war and uproar in the land,
and the <i>King</i> had to take up arms against another king
who wished to take the kingdom from him. So when
the lad heard that, he begged the gaoler to go to the
<i>King</i> and ask for a coat of mail and a sword, and for
leave to go to the war. All the rest laughed when the
gaoler told his errand, and begged the <i>King</i> to let him
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_161" name="page_161"></a>161</span>
have an old worn-out suit, that they might have the fun
of seeing such a wretch in battle. So he got that, and
an old broken-down hack besides, which went upon
three legs, and dragged the fourth after it.</p>

<p class="caption">
<i>The Lad in the Battle.</i><br>
</p>
</div>
<p>Then they went out to meet the foe; but they hadn’t
got far from the palace before the lad got stuck fast in a bog
with his hack. There he sat and dug his spurs in, and
cried, “Gee up! gee up!” to his hack. And all the rest
had their fun out of this, and laughed, and made game of the
lad as they rode past him. But they were scarcely gone,
before he ran to the lime-tree, threw on his coat of mail,
and shook the bridle, and there came the <i>Horse</i> in a trice,
and said: “Do now your best, and I’ll do mine.”</p>
<p>But when the lad came up the battle had begun,
and the <i>King</i> was in a sad pinch; but no sooner had
the lad rushed into the thick of it than the foe was
beaten back, and put to flight. The <i>King</i> and his men
wondered and wondered who it could be who had come
to help them, but none of them got so near him as to
be able to talk to him, and as soon as the fight was
over he was gone. When they went back, there sat the
lad still in the bog, and dug his spurs into his three-legged
hack, and they all laughed again.</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_162" name="page_162"></a>162</span></div>
<p>“No! only just look,” they said; “there the fool sits
still.”</p>
<p>The next day when they went out to battle, they
saw the lad sitting there still, so they laughed again, and
made game of him; but as soon as ever they had ridden
by, the lad ran again to the lime-tree, and all happened
as on the first day. Every one wondered what strange
champion it could be that had helped them, but no one
got so near him as to say a word to him; and no one
guessed it could be the lad; that’s easy to understand.</p>
<p>So when they went home at night, and saw the lad
still sitting there on his hack, they burst out laughing at
him again, and one of them shot an arrow at him and
hit him in the leg. So he began to shriek and to bewail;
’twas enough to break one’s heart; and so the <i>King</i> threw
his pocket-handkerchief to him to bind his wound.</p>
<p>When they went out to battle the third day, the lad
still sat there.</p>
<p>“Gee up! gee up!” he said to his hack.</p>
<p>“Nay, nay,” said the <i>King’s</i> men; “if he won’t stick
there till he’s starved to death.”</p>
<p>And then they rode on, and laughed at him till they
were fit to fall from their horses. When they were
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_163" name="page_163"></a>163</span>
gone, he ran again to the lime, and came up to the
battle just in the very nick of time. This day he slew
the enemy’s king, and then the war was over at once.</p>
<div class="figtag">
<a name="linki_48" id="linki_48"></a>
</div>
<div class="figright" style="width:250px">
<img src="./eastofthesunwestofthemoon_files/gs21.png" alt="" title="" width="250" height="282"><br>
</div>
<p>When the battle was over, the <i>King</i> caught sight of
his handkerchief, which the strange warrior had bound
round his leg, and so it wasn’t hard to find him out.
So they took him with great joy between them to the
palace, and the <i>Princess</i>, who saw him from her window,
got so glad, no one can believe it.</p>
<p>“Here comes my own true love,” she said.</p>
<p>Then he took the pot of ointment and rubbed himself
on the leg, and after that he rubbed all the wounded,
and so they all got well again in a moment.</p>
<p>So he got the <i>Princess</i> to wife; but when he went
down into the stable where his horse was on the day
the wedding was to be, there it stood so dull and heavy,
and hung its ears down, and wouldn’t eat its corn. So
when the young <i>King</i>—for he was now a king, and
had got half the kingdom—spoke to him, and asked
what ailed him, the <i>Horse</i> said:</p>
<p>“Now I have helped you on, and now I won’t live
any longer. So just take the sword, and cut my head
off.”</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_164" name="page_164"></a>164</span></div>
<p>“No, I’ll do nothing of the kind,” said the young
<i>King</i>; “but you shall have all you want, and rest all
your life.”</p>
<p>“Well,” said the <i>Horse</i>, “if you don’t do as I tell
you, see if I don’t take your life somehow.”</p>
<p>So the <i>King</i> had to do what he asked; but when he
swung the sword and was to cut his head off, he was so
sorry he turned away his face, for he would not see the
stroke fall. But as soon as ever he had cut off the
head, there stood
the loveliest <i>Prince</i>
on the spot where
the horse had
stood.</p>
<p>“Why, where
in all the world
did you come
from?” asked the
<i>King</i>.</p>
<p>“It was I who
was a horse,” said
the <i>Prince</i>; “for
I was king of that
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_165" name="page_165"></a>165</span>
land whose king you slew yesterday. He it was who
threw this <i>Troll’s</i> shape over me, and sold me to the
<i>Troll</i>. But now he is slain I get my own again, and you
and I will be neighbour kings, but war we will never
make on one another.”</p>
<p>And they didn’t either; for they were friends as
long as they lived, and each paid the other very many
visits.</p>

were to go up to the hill-side to make themselves
fat, and the name of all three was “<i>Gruff</i>.”</p>
<p>On the way up was a bridge over a burn they had to
cross; and under the bridge lived a great ugly <i>Troll</i>, with
eyes as big as saucers, and a nose as long as a poker.</p>
<p>So first of all came the youngest billy-goat <i>Gruff</i> to
cross the bridge.</p>
<p>“Trip, trap!
trip, trap!” went
the bridge.</p>

<p>“Who’s that
tripping over my
bridge?” roared
the <i>Troll</i>.</p>
<p>“Oh! it is
only I, the tiniest
billy-goat <i>Gruff</i>;
and I’m going up
to the hill-side to
make myself fat,”
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_168" name="page_168"></a>168</span>
said the billy-goat, with such a small voice.</p>
<p>“Now, I’m coming to gobble you up,” said the
<i>Troll</i>.</p>
<p>“Oh, no! pray don’t take me. I’m too little, that I
am,” said the billy-goat; “wait a bit till the second billy-goat
<i>Gruff</i> comes, he’s much bigger.”</p>
<p>“Well! be off with you,” said the <i>Troll</i>.</p>
<p>A little while after came the second billy-goat <i>Gruff</i>
to cross the bridge.</p>
<p>“<span class="smcap">Trip, trap! trip, trap! trip, trap!</span>” went the bridge.</p>
<p>“WHO’S THAT tripping over my bridge?” roared
the <i>Troll</i>.</p>
<p>“Oh! It’s the second billy-goat <i>Gruff</i>, and I’m going
up to the hill-side to make myself fat,” said the billy-goat,
who hadn’t such a small voice.</p>
<p>“Now, I’m coming to gobble you up,” said the <i>Troll</i>.</p>
<p>“Oh, no! don’t take me, wait a little till the big billy-goat
<i>Gruff</i> comes, he’s much bigger.”</p>
<p>“Very well! be off with you,” said the <i>Troll</i>.</p>
<p>But just then up came the big billy-goat <i>Gruff</i>.</p>
<p>“TRIP, TRAP! TRIP, TRAP! TRIP, TRAP!”
went the bridge, for the billy-goat was so heavy that the
bridge creaked and groaned under him.</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_169" name="page_169"></a>169</span></div>
<p>“WHO’S THAT tramping over my bridge?” roared
the <i>Troll</i>.</p>
<p>“IT’S I! THE BIG BILLY-GOAT GRUFF,” said
the billy-goat, who had an ugly hoarse voice of his own.</p>
<p>“Now, I’m coming to gobble you up,” roared the

<p>That was what the big billy-goat said; and so he flew
at the <i>Troll</i> and poked his eyes out with his horns, and
crushed him to bits, body and bones, and tossed him out
into the burn, and after that he went up to the hill-side.
There the billy-goats got so fat they were scarce able to
walk home again; and if the fat hasn’t fallen off them,

<p><img class="dcap" src="./eastofthesunwestofthemoon_files/drop_t.png" alt="T" title="" width="75" height="74"><span class="smcap"><span class="dcap">T</span>here</span> were once upon a time a <i>King</i> and <i>Queen</i>
who had no children, and they took it so much
to heart that they hardly ever had a happy
moment. One day the <i>King</i> stood in the portico and
looked out over the big meadows and all that was his.
But he felt he could have no enjoyment out of it all, since
he did not know what would become of it after his time.
As he stood there pondering, an old beggar woman came
up to him and asked him for a trifle in heaven’s name.
She greeted him and curtsied, and asked what ailed the
<i>King</i>, since he looked so sad.</p>
<p>“You can’t do anything to help me, my good woman,”
said the <i>King</i>; “it’s no use telling you.”</p>
<p>“I am not so sure about that,” said the beggar
woman. “Very little is wanted when luck is in the
way. The <i>King</i> is thinking that he has no heir to his
crown and kingdom, but he need not mourn on that
account,” she said. “The <i>Queen</i> shall have three
daughters, but great care must be taken that they do not
come out under the open heavens before they are all
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_172" name="page_172"></a>172</span>
fifteen years old; otherwise a snowdrift will come and
carry them away.”</p>
<p>When the time came the <i>Queen</i> had a beautiful baby
girl; the year after she had another, and the third year
she also had a girl.</p>
<p>The <i>King</i> and <i>Queen</i> were glad beyond all measure;
but although the <i>King</i> was very happy, he did not forget
to set a watch at the Palace door, so that the <i>Princesses</i>
should not get out.</p>
<p>As they grew up they became both fair and beautiful,
and all went well with them in every way. Their only
sorrow was that they were not allowed to go out and play
like other children. For all they begged and prayed
their parents, and for all they besought the sentinel, it
was of no avail; go out they must not before they were
fifteen years old, all of them.</p>
<p>So one day, not long before the fifteenth birthday of
the youngest <i>Princess</i>, the <i>King</i> and the <i>Queen</i> were out
driving, and the <i>Princesses</i> were standing at the window
and looking out. The sun was shining, and everything
looked so green and beautiful that they felt that they
must go out, happen what might. So they begged and
entreated and urged the sentinel, all three of them, that
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_173" name="page_173"></a>173</span>
he should let them down into the garden. “He could
see for himself how warm and pleasant it was; no snowy
weather could come on such a day.” Well, he didn’t
think it looked much like it either, and if they must go
they had better go, the soldier said; but it must only be
for a minute, and he himself would go with them and
look after them.</p>
<p>When they got down into the garden they ran up and
down, and filled their laps with flowers and green leaves,
the prettiest they could find. At last they could manage
no more, but just as they were going indoors they caught
sight of a large rose at the other end of the garden. It was
many times prettier than any they had gathered, so they
must have that also. But just as they bent down to take
the rose a big dense snowdrift came and carried them away.</p>

<p>There was great mourning over the whole country,
and the <i>King</i> made known from all the churches that any
one who could save the <i>Princesses</i> should have half the
kingdom and his golden crown and whichever princess
he liked to choose.</p>
<p>You can well understand there were plenty who wanted
to gain half the kingdom, and a princess into the bargain;
so there were people of both high and low degree who
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_174" name="page_174"></a>174</span>
set out for all parts of the country. But there was no
one who could find the <i>Princesses</i>, or even get any tidings
of them.</p>
<p>When all the grand and rich people in the country
had had their turn, a captain and a lieutenant came to the
Palace, and wanted to try their luck. The <i>King</i> fitted
them out both with silver and gold, and wished them
success on their journey.</p>
<p>Then came a soldier, who lived with his mother in a
little cottage some way from the Palace. He had dreamt
one night that he also was trying to find the <i>Princesses</i>.
When the morning came he still remembered what he had
dreamt, and told his mother about it.</p>
<p>“Some witchery must have got hold of you,” said the
woman, “but you must dream the same thing three nights
running, else there is nothing in it.” And the next two
nights the same thing happened; he had the same dream,
and he felt he must go. So he washed himself and put
on his uniform, and went into the kitchen at the Palace.
It was the day after the captain and the lieutenant had
set out.</p>
<p>“You had better go home again,” said the <i>King</i>, “the
<i>Princesses</i> are beyond your reach, I should say; and
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_175" name="page_175"></a>175</span>
besides, I have spent so much money on outfits that I
have nothing left to-day. You had better come back
another time.”</p>
<p>“If I go, I must go to-day,” said the soldier. “Money
I do not want; I only need a drop in my flask and some
food in my wallet,” he said; “but it must be a good
walletful—as much meat and bacon as I can carry.”</p>
<p>Yes, that he might have if that was all he wanted.</p>
<p>So he set off, and he had not gone many miles before
he overtook the captain and the lieutenant.</p>
<p>“Where are you going?” asked the captain, when he
saw the man in uniform.</p>
<p>“I’m going to try if I can find the <i>Princesses</i>,”
answered the soldier.</p>
<p>“So are we,” said the captain, “and since your
errand is the same, you may keep company with us, for
if we don’t find them, you are not likely to find them
either, my lad,” said he.</p>
<p>When they had gone awhile the soldier left the high
road, and took a path into the forest.</p>
<p>“Where are you going?” said the captain; “it is best
to follow the high road.”</p>
<p>“That may be,” said the soldier, “but this is my way.”</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_176" name="page_176"></a>176</span></div>
<p>He kept to the path, and when the others saw this they
turned round and followed him. Away they went further
and further, far across big moors and along narrow valleys.</p>
<p>And at last it became lighter, and when they had got
out of the forest altogether they came to a long bridge,
which they had to cross. But on that bridge a bear
stood on guard. He rose on his hind legs and came
towards them, as if he wanted to eat them.</p>
<p>“What shall we do now?” said the captain.</p>
<p>“They say that the bear is fond of meat,” said the
soldier, and then he threw a fore quarter to him, and so
they got past. But when they reached the other end of
the bridge, they saw a lion, which came roaring towards
them with open jaws as if he wanted to swallow them.</p>
<p>“I think we had better turn right-about, we shall
never be able to get past him alive,” said the captain.</p>
<p>“Oh, I don’t think he is so very dangerous,” said the
soldier; “I have heard that lions are very fond of bacon,
and I have half a pig in my wallet;” and then he threw
a ham to the lion, who began eating and gnawing, and
thus they got past him also.</p>
<p>In the evening they came to a fine big house. Each
room was more gorgeous than the other; all was glitter
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_177" name="page_177"></a>177</span>
and splendour wherever they looked; but that did not
satisfy their hunger. The captain and the lieutenant
went round rattling their money, and wanted to buy some
food; but they saw no people nor could they find a
crumb of anything in the house, so the soldier offered
them some food from his wallet, which they were not too
proud to accept, nor did they want any pressing. They
helped themselves of what he had as if they had never
tasted food before.</p>
<p>The next day the captain said they would have to go
out shooting and try to get something to live upon.
Close to the house was a large forest where there were
plenty of hares and birds. The lieutenant was to remain
at home and cook the remainder of the food in the
soldier’s wallet. In the meantime the captain and the
soldier shot so much game that they were hardly able to
carry it home. When they came to the door they found
the lieutenant in such a terrible plight that he was scarcely
able to open the door to them.</p>
<p>“What is the matter with you?” said the captain.
The lieutenant then told them that as soon as they were
gone a tiny, little man, with a long beard, who went on
crutches, came in and asked so plaintively for a penny; but
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_178" name="page_178"></a>178</span>
no sooner had he got it than he let it fall on the floor,
and for all he raked and scraped with his crutch he was
not able to get hold of it, so stiff and stark was he.</p>
<p>“I pitied the poor, old body,” said the lieutenant,
“and so I bent down to pick up the penny, but then he
was neither stiff nor stark any longer. He began to
belabour me with his crutches till very soon I was unable
to move a limb.”</p>
<p>“You ought to be ashamed of yourself! you, one of
the king’s officers, to let an old cripple give you a thrashing,
and then tell people of it into the bargain!” said the
captain. “Pshaw! to-morrow I’ll stop at home, and then
you’ll hear another story.”</p>
<p>The next day the lieutenant and the soldier went out
shooting and the captain remained at home to do the
cooking and look after the house. But if he fared no
worse, he certainly fared no better than the lieutenant.
In a little while the old man came in and asked for a
penny. He let it fall as soon as he got it; gone it was
and could not be found. So he asked the captain to help
him to find it, and the captain, without giving a thought,
bent down to look for it. But no sooner was he on his
knees than the cripple began belabouring him with his
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_179" name="page_179"></a>179</span>
crutches, and every time the captain tried to rise, he got
a blow which sent him reeling. When the others came
home in the evening, he still lay on the same spot and
could neither see nor speak.</p>
<p>The third day the soldier was to remain at home,
while the other two went out shooting. The captain
said he must take care of himself, “for the old fellow will
soon put an end to you, my lad,” said he.</p>
<p>“Oh, there can’t be much life in one if such an old
crook can take it,” said the soldier.</p>
<p>They were no sooner outside the door, than the old
man came in and asked for a penny again.</p>
<p>“Money I have never owned,” said the soldier, “but
food I’ll give you, as soon as it is ready,” said he, “but
if we are to get it cooked, you must go and cut the
wood.”</p>
<p>“That I can’t,” said the old man.</p>
<p>“If you can’t, you must learn,” said the soldier.
“I will soon show you. Come along with me down to the
wood-shed.” There he dragged out a heavy log and cut
a cleft in it, and drove in a wedge till the cleft deepened.</p>
<p>“Now you must lie down and look right along the cleft,
and you’ll soon learn how to cut wood,” said the soldier.
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_180" name="page_180"></a>180</span>
“In the meantime I’ll show you how to use the axe.”</p>
<p>The old man was not sufficiently cunning, and did as
he was told; he lay down and looked steadily along the
log. When the soldier saw the old man’s beard had got
well into the cleft, he struck out the wedge; the cleft
closed and the old man was caught by the beard. The
soldier began to beat him with the axe handle, and then
swung the axe round his head, and vowed that he would
split his skull if he did not tell him, there and then, where
the <i>Princesses</i> were.</p>
<p>“Spare my life, spare my life, and I’ll tell you!” said
the old man. “To the east of the house there is a big
mound; on top of the mound you must dig out a square
piece of turf, and then you will see a big stone slab.
Under that there is a deep hole through which you must
let yourself down, and you’ll then come to another world
where you will find the <i>Princesses</i>. But the way is long
and dark and it goes both through fire and water.”</p>
<p>When the soldier got to know this, he released the
old man, who was not long in making off.</p>
<p>When the captain and lieutenant came home they
were surprised to find the soldier alive. He told them
what had happened from first to last, where the <i>Princesses</i>
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_181" name="page_181"></a>181</span>
were and how they should find them. They became as
pleased as if they had already found them, and when they
had had some food, they took with them a basket and as
much rope as they could find, and all three set off to the
mound. There they first dug out the turf just as the old
man had told them, and underneath they found a big stone
slab, which it took all their strength to turn over. They
then began to measure how deep it was; they joined on
ropes both two and three times, but they were no nearer
the bottom the last time than the first. At last they had
to join all the ropes they had, both the coarse and fine,
and then they found it reached the bottom.</p>
<p>The captain was, of course, the first who wanted
to descend; “But when I tug at the rope you must
make haste to drag me up again,” he said. He found
the way both dark and unpleasant, but he thought he
would go on as long as it became no worse. But all at
once he felt ice cold water spouting about his ears; he
became frightened to death and began tugging at the rope.</p>
<p>The lieutenant was the next to try, but it fared no
better with him. No sooner had he got through the
flood of water than he saw a blazing fire yawning beneath
him, which so frightened him that he also turned back.</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_182" name="page_182"></a>182</span></div>
<p>The soldier then got into the bucket, and down he
went through fire and water, right on till he came to the
bottom, where it was so pitch dark that he could not see
his hand before him. He dared not let go the basket,
but went round in a circle, feeling and fumbling about
him. At last he discovered a gleam of light far, far
away like the dawn of day, and he went on in that
direction.</p>
<p>When he had gone a bit it began to grow light around
him, and before long he saw a golden sun rising in the
sky and everything around him became as bright and
beautiful as if in a fairy world.</p>
<p>First he came to some cattle, which were so fat that
their hides glistened a long way off, and when he had got
past them he came to a fine, big palace. He walked
through many rooms without meeting anybody. At last
he heard the hum of a spinning wheel, and when he
entered the room he found the eldest <i>Princess</i> sitting
there spinning copper yarn; the room and everything in
it was of brightly polished copper.</p>
<p>“Oh, dear; oh, dear! what are Christian people doing
here?” said the <i>Princess</i>. “Heaven preserve you! what
do you want?”</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_183" name="page_183"></a>183</span></div>

<p>“I want to
set you free and
get you out of the
mountain,” said
the soldier.</p>
<p>“Pray do not
stay. If the troll
comes home he
will put an end to
you at once; he
has three heads,”
said she.</p>
<p>“I do not care
if he has four,”
said the soldier. “I am here, and here I shall remain.”</p>
<p>“Well, if you will be so headstrong, I must see if I
can help you,” said the <i>Princess</i>.</p>
<p>She then told him to creep behind the big brewing
vat which stood in the front hall; meanwhile she would
receive the troll and scratch his heads till he went to sleep.</p>
<p>“And when I go out and call the hens you must
make haste and come in,” she said. “But you must first
try if you can swing the sword which is lying on the
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_184" name="page_184"></a>184</span>
table.” No, it was too heavy, he could not even move
it. He had then to take a strengthening draught from
the horn, which hung behind the door; after that he
was just able to stir it, so he took another draught,
and then he could lift it. At last he took a right,
big draught, and he could swing the sword as easily as
anything.</p>
<p>All at once the troll came home; he walked so
heavily that the palace shook.</p>
<p>“Ugh, ugh! I smell Christian flesh and blood in
my house,” said he.</p>
<p>“Yes,” answered the <i>Princess</i>, “a raven flew past here
just now, and in his beak he had a human bone, which
he dropped down the chimney; I threw it out and swept
and cleaned up after it, but I suppose it still smells.”</p>
<p>“So it does,” said the troll.</p>
<p>“But come and lie down and I’ll scratch your heads,”
said the <i>Princess</i>; “the smell will be gone by the time
you wake.”</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>The troll was quite willing, and before long he fell
asleep and began snoring. When she saw he was sleeping
soundly, she placed some stools and cushions under
his heads and went to call the hens. The soldier then
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_185" name="page_185"></a>185</span>
stole into the room with the sword, and with one blow
cut all the three heads off the troll.</p>
<p>The <i>Princess</i> was as pleased as a fiddler, and went
with the soldier to her sisters, so that he could also set
them free. First of all they went across a courtyard and
then through many long rooms till they came to a big
door.</p>
<p>“Here you must enter: here she is,” said the <i>Princess</i>.
When he opened the door he found himself in a large
hall, where everything was of pure silver; there sat the
second sister at a silver spinning-wheel.</p>
<p>“Oh, dear; oh, dear!” she said. “What do you
want here?”</p>
<p>“I want to set you free from the troll,” said the
soldier.</p>
<p>“Pray do not stay, but go,” said the <i>Princess</i>. “If
he finds you here he will take your life on the spot.”</p>
<p>“That would be awkward—that is if I don’t take his
first,” said the soldier.</p>
<p>“Well, since you will stay,” she said, “you will have
to creep behind the big brewing-vat in the front hall. But
you must make haste and come as soon as you hear me
calling the hens.”</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_186" name="page_186"></a>186</span></div>
<p>First of all he had to try if he was able to swing the
troll’s sword, which lay on the table; it was much larger
and heavier than the first one; he was hardly able to move
it. He then took three draughts from the horn and he
could then lift it, and when he had taken three more he
could handle it as if it were a rolling pin.</p>
<p>Shortly afterwards he heard a heavy, rumbling noise
that was quite terrible, and directly afterwards a troll with
six heads came in.</p>
<p>“Ugh, ugh!” he said as soon as he got his noses
inside the door. “I smell Christian blood and bone in
my house.”</p>
<p>“Yes, just think! A raven came flying past here with
a thigh-bone, which he dropped down the chimney,” said
the <i>Princess</i>. “I threw it out, but the raven brought it
back again. At last I got rid of it and made haste to
clean the room, but I suppose the smell is not quite gone,”
she said.</p>
<p>“No, I can smell it well,” said the troll; but he was
tired and put his heads in the <i>Princess’s</i> lap, and she went
on scratching them till they all fell a-snoring. Then she
called the hens, and the soldier came and cut off all the
six heads as if they were set on cabbage stalks.</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_187" name="page_187"></a>187</span></div>
<p>She was no less glad than her elder sister, as you may
imagine, and danced and sang; but in the midst of their
joy they remembered their youngest sister. They went
with the soldier across a large courtyard, and, after walking
through many, many rooms, he came to the hall of gold
where the third sister was.</p>
<p>She sat at a golden spinning-wheel spinning gold yarn,
and the room from ceiling to floor glistened and glittered
till it hurt one’s eyes.</p>
<p>“Heaven preserve both you and me, what do you
want here?” said the <i>Princess</i>. “Go, go, else the troll
will kill us both.”</p>
<p>“Just as well two as one,” answered the soldier. The
<i>Princess</i> cried and wept; but it was all of no use, he must
and would remain. Since there was no help for it he
would have to try if he could use the troll’s sword on
the table in the front hall. But he was only just able to
move it; it was still larger and heavier than the other two
swords.</p>
<p>He then had to take the horn down from the wall
and take three draughts from it, but was only just able to
stir the sword. When he had taken three more draughts
he could lift it, and when he had taken another three he
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_188" name="page_188"></a>188</span>
swung it as easily
as if it had been a
feather.</p>
<div class="figtag">
<a name="linki_55" id="linki_55"></a>
</div>
<div class="figright" style="width:250px">
<img src="./eastofthesunwestofthemoon_files/gs24.png" alt="" title="" width="250" height="280"><br>
</div>
<p>The <i>Princess</i>
then settled with
the soldier to do
the same as her
sisters had done.
As soon as the troll
was well asleep she
would call the
hens, and he must
then make haste
and come in and
put an end to the troll.</p>
<p>All of a sudden they heard such a thundering, rambling
noise, as if the walls and roof were tumbling in.</p>
<p>“Ugh! Ugh! I smell Christian blood and bone in
my house,” said the troll, sniffing with all his nine noses.</p>
<p>“Yes, you never saw the like! Just now a raven flew
past here and dropped a human bone down the chimney.
I threw it out, but the raven brought it back, and this
went on for some time,” said the <i>Princess</i>; but she got it
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_189" name="page_189"></a>189</span>
buried at last, she said, and she had both swept and
cleaned the place, but she supposed it still smelt.</p>
<p>“Yes, I can smell it well,” said the troll.</p>
<p>“Come here and lie down in my lap and I will
scratch your heads,” said the <i>Princess</i>. “The smell will
be all gone when you awake.”</p>
<p>He did so, and when he was snoring at his best she
put stools and cushions under the heads so that she could
get away to call the hens. The soldier then came in in
his stockinged feet and struck at the troll, so that eight
of the heads fell off at one blow. But the sword was
too short and did not reach far enough; the ninth head
woke up and began to roar.</p>
<p>“Ugh! Ugh! I smell a Christian.”</p>
<p>“Yes, here he is,” answered the soldier, and before
the troll could get up and seize hold of him the soldier
struck him another blow and the last head rolled along
the floor.</p>
<p>You can well imagine how glad the <i>Princesses</i> became
now that they no longer had to sit and scratch the trolls’
heads; they did not know how they could do enough for
him who had saved them. The youngest <i>Princess</i> took off
her gold ring and knotted it in his hair. They then took
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_190" name="page_190"></a>190</span>
with them as much gold and silver as they thought they
could carry and set off on their way home.</p>

<i>As soon as they tugged at the rope, the Captain and the Lieutenant pulled up the Princesses, the one after the other.</i><br>
</p>
</div>
<p>As soon as they tugged at the rope the captain and the
lieutenant pulled up the <i>Princesses</i>, the one after the other.
But when they were safely up, the soldier thought it was
foolish of him not to have gone up before the <i>Princesses</i>,
for he had not very much belief in his comrades. He
thought he would first try them, so he put a heavy lump
of gold in the basket and got out of the way. When the
basket was half-way up they cut the rope and the lump
of gold fell to the bottom with such a crash that the pieces
flew about his ears.</p>
<p>“Now we are rid of him,” they said, and threatened
the <i>Princesses</i> with their life if they did not say that it was
they who had saved them from the trolls. They were
forced to agree to this, much against their will, and especially
the youngest <i>Princess</i>; but life was precious, and
so the two who were strongest had their way.</p>
<p>When the captain and lieutenant got home with the
<i>Princesses</i> you may be sure there were great rejoicings at
the palace. The <i>King</i> was so glad he didn’t know which
leg to stand on; he brought out his best wine from his
cupboard and wished the two officers welcome. If they
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_191" name="page_191"></a>191</span>
had never been honoured before they were honoured now
in full measure, and no mistake. They walked and strutted
about the whole of the day, as if they were the cocks of
the walk, since they were now going to have the <i>King</i>
for father-in-law. For it was understood they should
each have whichever of the <i>Princesses</i> they liked and half
the kingdom between them. They both wanted the
youngest <i>Princess</i>, but for all they prayed and threatened
her it was of no use; she would not hear or listen to
either.</p>
<p>They then asked the <i>King</i> if they might have twelve
men to watch over her; she was so sad and melancholy
since she had been in the mountain that they were afraid
she might do something to herself.</p>
<p>Yes, that they might have, and the <i>King</i> himself told
the watch they must look well after her and follow her
wherever she went and stood.</p>
<p>They then began to prepare for the wedding of the
two eldest sisters; it should be such a wedding as never
was heard or spoken of before, and there was no end to
the brewing and the baking and the slaughtering.</p>
<p>In the meantime the soldier walked and strolled about
down in the other world. He thought it was hard that
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_192" name="page_192"></a>192</span>
he should see neither people nor daylight any more; but
he would have to do something, he thought, and so for
many days he went about from room to room and opened
all the drawers and cupboards and searched about on the
shelves and looked at all the fine things that were there.
At last he came to a drawer in a table, in which there lay
a golden key; he tried this key to all the locks he could
find, but there was none it fitted till he came to a little
cupboard over the bed, and in that he found an old rusty
whistle. “I wonder if there is any sound in it,” he
thought, and put it to his mouth. No sooner had he
whistled than he heard a whizzing and a whirring from
all quarters, and such a large flock of birds swept down,
that they blackened all the field in which they settled.</p>
<div class="figtag">

<i>No sooner had he whistled than he heard a whizzing and a whirring from all quarters, and such a large flock of birds swept down that they blackened all the field in which they settled.</i><br>
</p>
</div>
<p>“What does our master want to-day?” they asked.</p>
<p>If he were their master, the soldier said, he would
like to know if they could tell him how to get up to the
earth again. No, none of them knew anything about
that; “But our mother has not yet arrived,” they said;
“if she can’t help you, no one can.”</p>
<p>So he whistled once more, and shortly heard something
flapping its wings far away, and then it began to blow so
hard that he was carried away between the houses like a
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_193" name="page_193"></a>193</span>
wisp of hay across the courtyard, and if he had not caught
hold of the fence he would no doubt have been blown
away altogether.</p>
<p>A big eagle—bigger than you can imagine—then
swooped down in front of him.</p>
<p>“You come rather sharply,” said the soldier.</p>
<p>“As you whistle so I come,” answered the eagle. So
he asked her if she knew any means by which he could
get away from the world in which they were.</p>
<p>“You can’t get away from here unless you can fly,”
said the eagle, “but if you will slaughter twelve oxen for
me, so that I can have a really good meal, I will try and
help you. Have you got a knife?”</p>
<p>“No, but I have a sword,” he said. When the eagle
had swallowed the twelve oxen she asked the soldier to kill
one more for victuals on the journey. “Every time I gape
you must be quick and fling a piece into my mouth,” she
said, “else I shall not be able to carry you up to earth.”</p>
<p>He did as she asked him and hung two large bags of
meat round her neck and seated himself among her feathers.
The eagle then began to flap her wings and off they went
through the air like the wind. It was as much as the soldier
could do to hold on, and it was with the greatest
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_194" name="page_194"></a>194</span>
difficulty he managed to throw the pieces of flesh into the
eagle’s mouth every time she opened it.</p>
<p>At last the day began to dawn, and the eagle was then
almost exhausted and began flapping with her wings, but
the soldier was prepared and seized the last hind quarter
and flung it to her. Then she gained strength and brought
him up to earth. When she had sat and rested a while at
the top of a large pine-tree she set off with him again at
such a pace that flashes of lightning were seen both by
sea and land wherever they went.</p>
<p>Close to the palace the soldier got off and the eagle
flew home again, but first she told him that if he at any
time should want her he need only blow the whistle and
she would be there at once.</p>
<p>In the meantime everything was ready at the palace,
and the time approached when the captain and lieutenant
were to be married with the two eldest <i>Princesses</i>, who,
however, were not much happier than their youngest
sister; scarcely a day passed without weeping and mourning,
and the nearer the wedding-day approached the more
sorrowful did they become.</p>
<p>At last the <i>King</i> asked what was the matter with
them; he thought it was very strange that they were not
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_195" name="page_195"></a>195</span>
merry and happy now that they were saved and had been
set free and were going to be married. They had to give
some answer, and so the eldest sister said they never would
be happy any more unless they could get such checkers as
they had played with in the blue mountain.</p>
<p>That, thought the <i>King</i>, could be easily managed, and
so he sent word to all the best and cleverest goldsmiths in
the country that they should make these checkers for the
<i>Princesses</i>. For all they tried there was no one who could
make them. At last all the goldsmiths had been to the
palace except one, and he was an old, infirm man who had
not done any work for many years except odd jobs, by
which he was just able to keep himself alive. To him the
soldier went and asked to be apprenticed. The old man
was so glad to get him, for he had not had an apprentice
for many a day, that he brought out a flask from his chest
and sat down to drink with the soldier. Before long the
drink got into his head, and when the soldier saw this he
persuaded him to go up to the palace and tell the <i>King</i>
that he would undertake to make the checkers for the
<i>Princesses</i>.</p>
<p>He was ready to do that on the spot; he had made
finer and grander things in his day, he said. When the
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_196" name="page_196"></a>196</span>
<i>King</i> heard there was some one outside who could make
the checkers he was not long in coming out.</p>
<p>“Is it true what you say, that you can make such
checkers as my daughters want?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Yes, it is no lie,” said the goldsmith; that he would
answer for.</p>
<p>“That’s well!” said the <i>King</i>. “Here is the gold
to make them with; but if you do not succeed you will
lose your life, since you have come and offered yourself,
and they must be finished in three days.”</p>
<p>The next morning when the goldsmith had slept off
the effects of the drink, he was not quite so confident
about the job. He wailed and wept and blew up his
apprentice, who had got him into such a scrape while he
was drunk. The best thing would be to make short
work of himself at once, he said, for there could be no
hope for his life; when the best and grandest goldsmiths
could not make such checkers, was it likely that he could
do it?</p>
<p>“Don’t fret on that account,” said the soldier, “but
let me have the gold and I’ll get the checkers ready in time;
but I must have a room to myself to work in,” he said.
This he got, and thanks into the bargain.</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_197" name="page_197"></a>197</span></div>
<p>The time wore on, and the soldier did nothing but
lounge about, and the goldsmith began to grumble, because
he would not begin with the work.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry yourself about it,” said the soldier,
“there is plenty of time! If you are not satisfied with
what I have promised you had better make them yourself.”
The same thing went on both that day and the next; and
when the smith heard neither hammer nor file from the
soldier’s room the whole of the last day, he quite gave
himself up for lost; it was now no use to think any longer
about saving his life, he thought.</p>
<p>But when the night came on the soldier opened the
window and blew his whistle. The eagle then came and
asked what he wanted.</p>
<p>“Those gold checkers, which the <i>Princesses</i> had
in the blue mountain,” said the soldier; “but you’ll
want something to eat first, I suppose? I have two
ox carcases lying ready for you in the hay-loft yonder;
you had better finish them,” he said. When the eagle
had done she did not tarry, and long before the sun
rose she was back again with the checkers. The
soldier then put them under his bed and lay down to
sleep.</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_198" name="page_198"></a>198</span></div>
<p>Early next morning the goldsmith came and knocked
at his door.</p>
<p>“What are you after now again?” asked the soldier.
“You rush about enough in the day, goodness knows!
If one cannot have peace when one is in bed, whoever
would be an apprentice here?” said he.</p>
<p>Neither praying nor begging helped that time; the
goldsmith must and would come in, and at last he was
let in.</p>
<p>And then, you may be sure, there was soon an end
to his wailing.</p>
<p>But still more glad than the goldsmith were the
<i>Princesses</i>, when he came up to the palace with the
checkers, and gladdest of all was the youngest <i>Princess</i>.</p>
<p>“Have you made them yourself?” she asked.</p>
<p>“No, if I must speak the truth, it is not I,” he said,
“but my apprentice, who has made them.”</p>
<p>“I should like to see that apprentice,” said the <i>Princess</i>.
In fact all three wanted to see him, and if he valued his
life, he would have to come.</p>
<p>He was not afraid, either of women-folk or grand-folk,
said the soldier, and if it could be any amusement to them
to look at his rags, they should soon have that pleasure.</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_199" name="page_199"></a>199</span></div>
<p>The youngest <i>Princess</i> recognised him at once; she
pushed the soldiers aside and ran up to him, gave him her
hand, and said:</p>
<p>“Good day, and many thanks for all you have done
for us. It is he who freed us from the trolls in the
mountain,” she said to the <i>King</i>. “He is the one I will
have!” and then she pulled off his cap and showed them
the ring she had tied in his hair.</p>
<p>It soon came out how the captain and lieutenant had
behaved, and so they had to pay the penalty of their
treachery with their lives, and that was the end of their
grandeur. But the soldier got the golden crown and
half the kingdom, and married the youngest <i>Princess</i>.</p>
<p>At the wedding they drank and feasted both well and
long; for feast they all could, even if they could not find
the <i>Princesses</i>, and if they have not yet done feasting and
drinking they must be at it still.</p>

who had caught a great white bear, which he
was going to take to the King of Denmark.
Now, it so fell out, that he came to the <i>Dovrefell</i> just
about Christmas Eve, and there he turned into a cottage
where a man lived, whose name was Halvor, and asked
the man if he could get house-room there for his bear
and himself.</p>
<p>“Heaven never help me, if what I say isn’t true!”
said the man; “but we can’t give anyone house-room just
now, for every Christmas Eve such a pack of <i>Trolls</i> come
down upon us, that we are forced to flit, and haven’t so
much as a house over our own heads, to say nothing of
lending one to anyone else.”</p>
<p>“Oh?” said the man, “if that’s all, you can very well
lend me your house; my bear can lie under the stove
yonder, and I can sleep in the side-room.”</p>
<p>Well, he begged so hard, that at last he got leave to
stay there; so the people of the house flitted out, and before
they went, everything was got ready for the <i>Trolls</i>;
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_201" name="page_201"></a>201</span>
the tables were laid, and there was rice porridge, and fish
boiled in lye, and sausages, and all else that was good,
just as for any other grand feast.</p>
<p>So, when everything was ready, down came the <i>Trolls</i>.
Some were great, and some were small; some had long
tails, and some had no tails at all; some, too, had long,
long noses; and they ate and drank, and tasted everything.
Just then one of the little <i>Trolls</i> caught sight of the white
bear, who lay under the stove; so he took a piece of
sausage and stuck it on a fork, and went and poked it up
against the bear’s nose, screaming out:</p>
<p>“Pussy, will you have some sausage?”</p>
<p>Then the white bear rose up and growled, and
hunted the whole pack of them out of doors, both great
and small.</p>
<p>Next year Halvor was out in the wood, on the afternoon
of Christmas Eve, cutting wood before the holidays,
for he thought the <i>Trolls</i> would come again; and just as
he was hard at work, he heard a voice in the wood calling
out:</p>
<p>“Halvor! Halvor!”</p>
<p>“Well,” said Halvor, “here I am.”</p>
<p>“Have you got your big cat with you still?”</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_202" name="page_202"></a>202</span></div>
<p>“Yes, that I have,” said Halvor; “she’s lying at
home under the stove, and what’s more, she has now got
seven kittens, far bigger and fiercer than she is herself.”</p>
<p>“Oh, then, we’ll never come to see you again,” bawled
out the <i>Troll</i> away in the wood, and he kept his word;
for since that time the <i>Trolls</i> have never eaten their
Christmas brose with Halvor on the <i>Dovrefell</i>.</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
